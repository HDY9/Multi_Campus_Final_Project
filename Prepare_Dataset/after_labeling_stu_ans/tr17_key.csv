If you drop one or two drops of an indicator, which is a weak acid, in an acidic solution, hydrogen attached to the indicator does not come off easily. This is because there are already many hydrogen ions in the solution. However, if a basic substance is added to the solution little by little, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution decreases, so that the hydrogen attached to the indicator is dissociated and the number of molecules present in an ionic state increases. As the acidity of the solution changes, the number of indicator molecules whose molecular structure changes increases, and the color of the molecule changes as the molecular structure changes. By observing the color that appears, you can find the approximate pH and find the neutralization point.
