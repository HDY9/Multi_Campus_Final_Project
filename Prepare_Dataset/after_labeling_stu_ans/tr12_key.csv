So, what Kim Chun-chu chose is the price of abandoning self-reliance in the name of preserving the country. So, he entered the Tang Sinha costume and planned a coalition, claiming to be a subordinate state of the Party, and the terms were to divide the Baekje-Goguryo-Land. From Silla's point of view, the goal was to occupy the Honam Plain and the Han River basin, and the Tang Dynasty was mainly to seek revenge on Goguryeo and absorb the Korean Peninsula from King Gwanggaeto. To be honest, the reason why China still hates Korea is that Tibet and Uighur absorb into China, but I don't like the fact that only the Korean Peninsula is not absorbed at the end of the continent and that a small country maintains its independence as a country. Silla eventually defended the Korean Peninsula with the Battle of Maesoseong and said it was unification, but in fact, it is a half-digit unification, and people say that it is not the unification of the Three Kingdoms, but ""Baekje Occupation and Goguryeo Partial Occupation>. Since then, Balhae has been built by Daejoyeong, and the Manchurian Plain has become the owner of the Korean people again, but it is different from Goguryeo.
