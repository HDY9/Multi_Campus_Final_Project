Sucking such important water from the ground into the body of a plant is called the ""absorption"" of the root. The principle that the roots absorb water can be explained by osmotic pressure. Almost all of the membranes that make up the plant are semi-permeable membranes. When plants absorb water from their roots, comparing root hairs and water in the soil, the water in the soil is low and the root hairs are relatively high. In order to achieve concentration equilibrium, low concentration of moisture in the soil permeates into the high concentration of root hairs through the cell membrane.
