There is also a limit to infinitely satisfying the human desire to spend 80 million barrels of oil every day. It also emits greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide through the combustion of fossil fuels, which have a greenhouse effect on the Earth's atmosphere. And the average temperature of the Earth is bound to rise because the solar radiation energy coming in from the Earth is absorbed more and the energy released is reduced. So, as global temperatures rise, glaciers rise and water levels rise, flooding low-lying countries.",,

The acceleration of global warming will cause sea levels to rise, deepening abnormal weather.If coal and petroleum energy continue to be used, the price of fossil energy will increase, and then not only will it be hit hard by exhaustion or fossil energy, but carbon dioxide will increase, resulting in a greenhouse effect, deepening global warming. If global warming intensifies, various natural disasters will occur and glaciers will melt, reducing the space for humans to live. In addition, the use of fossil fuels increases fine dust, so humans may not be able to breathe freely.",,

Its effects will cause glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, resulting in flooding at lower elevations. Other than that, there will be many environmental problems. But I want to approach it from a different perspective. Using a lot of fossil energy would mean not thinking about the environment as much.
