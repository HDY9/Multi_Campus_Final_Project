911,"The Earth rotates around the sun at the same time. Earth's orbit is elliptical, so it does not always lie at the same distance as the Sun. As we orbit the Sun every year, the Earth is sometimes located close to the Sun, sometimes far away. The closer the sun is, the more solar energy it reaches the Earth, so the higher the temperature is and the farther the temperature is, the lower the temperature is. This principle causes seasonal changes.",,,,
