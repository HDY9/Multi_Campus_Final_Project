,2) Why was it so hard to breathe after the first few breaths?,q42_oxygen,q42_carbon dioxide,q42_air
0,It's because there's not enough oxygen,,,
1,Because we are running out of oxygen (O2).,,,
2,Because you're running out of oxygen to breathe,,,
3,Your lung capacity is bad because you haven't breathed for a long time,,,
4,It's because of the plastic,,,
5,full of carbon dioxide,,,
6,I think it will be bitter because it is difficult to breathe as the air is dry.,,,
7,There's oxygen in the plastic bag,,,
8,Breathe in the air,,,
9,"This is because when you inhale, all the air does not enter your mouth and there is some left in the bag.",,,
10,There is a lack of fresh air and air in the air,,,
11,"Because the fresh air disappears,",,,
12,This is because the air in the pe disappears a little while doing the exercise that the pe breathes.,,,
13,This is because the air escapes and filters out bad substances when breathing and exhaling air.,,,
14,I think it is because air is disappearing even though I breathe only when there is air.,,,
15,The air doesn't go through well,,,
16,The air came out of the plastic bag,,,
17,"The amount of air in the bag is that much, so even when you breathe, it will be hard because the air is gradually disappearing",,,
18,"The bag is filled with carbon dioxide, not oxygen",,,
19,"Because people breathe with oxygen, not carbon dioxide, they lack oxygen.",,,
20,"After you drink oxygen, you exhale carbon dioxide, so there will be carbon dioxide left in the bag.",,,
21,It's because the air is getting scarce.,,,
22,Just,,,
23,Just,,,
24,This is because there is a lack of breathing air.,,,
25,"At first, it was clear air, but when you breathe in and out, carbon dioxide comes out and fills the balloon.",,,
26,"Because of the carbon dioxide that people exhale, the air gets bad and a lot of air is gone",,,
27,This is because the air decreases while inhaling the lift.,,,
28,"Because the air that people exhale is carbon dioxide, the air gets worse and they can't breathe",,,
29,This is because I had no choice but to breathe only in a fixed space.,,,
30,be due to low air pressure,,,
31,"Oxygen turned into carbon dioxide, and oxygen ran out.",,,
32,The amount of air you breathe in is small and the air is warm.,,,
33,be due to the lack of oxygen,,,
34,The plastic bag got smaller,,,
35,Air comes out of the mouth or counts out of snow or plastic foil.,,,
36,There's a place where you can zoom in,,,
37,"We breathe with oxygen because there is carbon dioxide in the bag, not oxygen",,,
38,Because carbon dioxide interferes with human hopping and is very short of oxygen,,,
39,This is because it was difficult to breathe air that had been changed to carbon dioxide because drinking carbon dioxide made me feel stuffy.,,,
40,"There is air in the plastic bag, so if you breathe only in the plastic bag, the air gradually escapes and you can't breathe",,,
41,Because the air that you can breathe is disappearing,,,
42,There's not enough air in the bag,,,
43,This is because the air has disappeared in the bag.,,,
44,There's no air in the bag,,,
45,This is because the air disappears in the bag.,,,
46,I'm running low on oxygen,,,
47,I'm running out of air,,,
48,"Because the air was in a constant space,",,,
49,because of lack of oxygen,,,
50,The oxygen disappeared,,,
51,I think the air escaped through my nose and disappeared.,,,
52,Because the air disappears,,,
53,There's too much water,,,
54,"Because of the lack of lung capacity,",,,
55,I don't know.,,,
56,"Because when you breathe, you get carbon dioxide",,,
57,This is because the proportion of oxygen in the air in the plastic bag decreases.,,,
58,This is because it is a limited space for inhaling and exhaling air.,,,
59,Because it's hard,,,
60,"When you breathe in and out air, you breathe out carbon dioxide, so I think it's hard to breathe because of the lack of air.",,,
61,"At first, there was a lot of oxygen in the fresh air, but it's getting harder and harder to breathe because of the carbon dioxide that we breathe out.",,,
62,This is because the air in the bag is limited.,,,
63,"Since the air has changed, it becomes difficult because there is only other air, not the air we have to inhale.",,,
64,There's a lot of carbon dioxide,,,
65,I drank all the air in the bag,,,
66,I drank all the air in the bag,,,
67,I think it was difficult because the air I inhale gradually disappeared as I repeatedly inhale and exhale.,,,
68,Because you can hear it a lot?,,,
69,"If the proportion of carbon dioxide increases, carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin instead of oxygen, damaging the purification system in the body",,,
70,"Breathing uses oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the air, making breathing difficult In addition, excessive humidity in the air due to water vapor generated during the breathing process also contributes to difficulty in breathing",,,
71,This is because the amount of oxygen gas that can be absorbed during breathing has decreased.,,,
72,"As the concentration of carbon dioxide gas increases, the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli decreases, making it difficult to exchange gases.",,,
73,"Because the oxygen concentration of the incoming air is low,",,,
74,This is because the oxygen concentration decreases and the carbon dioxide concentration increases as you breathe.,,,
75,Reduced partial pressure difference reduces airflow into the lungs,,,
76,Because carbon dioxide gas increases,,,
77,I'm exhausted,,,
78,"At first, there was oxygen in the plastic bag, but after a few breaths, oxygen decreased and only carbon dioxide remained, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
79,This is because the oxygen in the bag was consumed repeatedly by inhaling and exhaling.,,,
80,"When inhaling, inhaling air, and when exhaling, exhaling carbon dioxide instead of inhaling air, the air becomes thinner and thinner, thus making it difficult to breathe.",,,
81,"The first few breaths had enough oxygen in the air, but after several breaths, the oxygen in the air gradually decreased and was not enough to breathe.",,,
82,"Due to breathing, oxygen decreases and carbon dioxide increases, making it difficult to breathe due to lack of oxygen required for breathing.",,,
83,"Breathing through oxygen in a plastic bag increases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the plastic bag, and after several times, the amount of oxygen decreases, making it difficult to breathe",,,
84,It's hard to breathe with carbon dioxide because it absorbs oxygen and exhaled carbon dioxide while breathing.,,,
85,This is because the concentration of oxygen required for breathing has decreased and the concentration of carbon dioxide has increased.,,,
86,This is because the amount of oxygen inside vinyl decreases as you inhale. It feels difficult to breathe because oxygen is not supplied to the alveoli.,,,
87,"The first plastic bag contained enough oxygen for us to breathe. Therefore, the first few times I breathed air, I could breathe. However, as we breathe using oxygen, we continue to exhale, and carbon dioxide is released. If we continue to breathe in this state, the amount of oxygen becomes insufficient for us to breathe. Therefore, it becomes difficult to breathe after inhaling air several times.",,,
88,"During the first few times, the relatively large amount of oxygen in a plastic bag was able to breathe smoothly, but over time, the amount of oxygen required for breathing is significantly reduced and difficult to breathe as it turns into air containing a small amount of oxygen and a large amount of carbon dioxide.",,,
89,"At first, oxygen remained in the bag to some extent, but when humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide in the process of exhaling, the amount of oxygen in the bag decreases and the amount of carbon dioxide increases. Since life needs oxygen to breathe, it becomes difficult to breathe if the amount of carbon dioxide in the bag is large and the amount of oxygen is small.",,,
90,"Human breathing needs oxygen, because through my breathing, the plastic bag is filled with carbon dioxide and there is no oxygen that humans need.",,,
91,The amount of oxygen in a plastic bag decreases and the amount of carbon dioxide increases as a person repeatedly inhales and exhales. People find it difficult to breathe because they cannot breathe with carbon dioxide.,,,
92,"At first, there was enough oxygen in the plastic bag to breathe, but as you continue to breathe, the oxygen in the plastic bag decreases, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
93,The lack of oxygen required for breathing makes it difficult to breathe.,,,
94,It is frustrating because the amount of carbon dioxide produced by exhalation increases in a bag filled with fresh air. This is also because the amount of oxygen decreases by inhaling oxygen through inhalation.,,,
95,"After several breaths, the air in the bag has less oxygen and relatively more carbon dioxide, so the amount of oxygen used to breathe in is reduced, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
96,"When humans breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, the amount of oxygen in the bag decreases, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
97,"Air contains 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases. Human breathing requires only oxygen. Therefore, when exhaling, air enters and iron in hemoglobin in red blood cells binds to oxygen in the blood vessels of the alveoli from the lungs, and nitrogen and other gases except the rest of the oxygen escape by exhalation. If you breathe a lot in that enclosed space, the oxygen concentration becomes insufficient, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
98,"At first, you can breathe because there is enough oxygen in the air, but you have difficulty breathing because the oxygen concentration in the air in the bag decreases while breathing.1)As shown in , the oxygen concentration inside the bag decreases and the carbon dioxide concentration increases, and we try to get oxygen when we breathe. Therefore, it becomes difficult to breathe as the oxygen concentration inside the bag decreases.",,,
99,"We can breathe using oxygen. And when you exhale, you exhale carbon dioxide. Now the bag is sealed because it is tightly attached to the mouth. Therefore, as you breathe, the amount of carbon dioxide increases and the amount of oxygen decreases. Therefore, the amount of oxygen required for breathing decreases, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
100,"As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases gradually,",,,
101,"The amount of oxygen in the bag decreases, making it difficult to breathe",,,
102,It must have been hard because the carbon dioxide concentration was high.,,,
103,"You breathe oxygen every time you breathe, so the more you breathe, the less oxygen you get",,,
104,The amount of carbon dioxide increases,,,
105,"After inhaling oxygen, there's carbon dioxide",,,
106,an increase in carbon dioxide,,,
107,"When people breathe in and out, they breathe in oxygen, and when they breathe out carbon dioxide, but if they continue to breathe, it becomes difficult to breathe because there is more carbon dioxide",,,
108,It will be difficult to breathe because there is only carbon dioxide in the bag.,,,
109,"This is because carbon dioxide is released when exhaled and oxygen is consumed when inhaled, so the air in the plastic bag has changed to carbon dioxide",,,
110,There's less air in the bag,,,
111,Carbon dioxide comes out when you spit it out and it's hard to breathe,,,
112,This is because it is difficult to breathe with carbon dioxide.,,,
113,I'm running low on oxygen,,,
114,"As explained above, the air in the bag is limited, and the oxygen in it is also limited People breathe with oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
115,This is because carbon dioxide increases and oxygen decreases.,,,
116,"If you continue to breathe, the oxygen in the bag is depleted, making it difficult to supply oxygen, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
117,It may be because there is more carbon dioxide in the bag by inhaling the oxygen in the bag and releasing carbon dioxide,,,
118,This is because the oxygen concentration required for breathing in the air decreased as you breathe.,,,
119,"Since the amount of oxygen decreases gradually, no matter how much you breathe, the amount of oxygen to the brain decreases and the body seems to be tired.",,,
120,There's a lot of carbon dioxide,,,
121,Because oxygen decreases and carbon dioxide increases,,,
122,It would have been difficult to breathe because of the reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide needed to breathe,,,
123,"When we breathe, we need oxygen, but the first bag had enough oxygen, but after several trials, it became difficult to breathe due to lack of oxygen.",,,
124,"At first, there was oxygen in the bag, but as he continued to breathe, the amount of oxygen decreased and the amount of carbon dioxide increased.",,,
125,"At first, there was oxygen in the fresh air, but after breathing several times, it becomes difficult to breathe because there is carbon dioxide.",,,
126,"As the amount of oxygen in the bag decreases and carbon dioxide increases, the oxygen required for breathing decreases, making it increasingly difficult to breathe.",,,
127,"At first, it was possible to breathe because there was a little oxygen in the bag, but as the outside oxygen could not enter the bag, only the exhaled carbon dioxide was filled in the bag, making it difficult to breathe",,,
128,"If you breathe out of an isolated space, you release carbon dioxide. And when you breathe in, you get the oxygen you need. This can be seen from the breathing process, and when breathing in, carbon dioxide circulating throughout the body diffuses from the alveoli to the atmosphere due to differences in concentration. Conversely, when breathing, oxygen in the atmosphere diffuses into the alveoli due to differences in concentration. So in an isolated bag, we can feel frustrated because we need less oxygen and more carbon dioxide that we don't need",,,
129,It's filled with carbon dioxide,,,
130,Breathe in all the remaining air,,,
131,"What you need to breathe is oxygen, but it's gone and there's a lot of carbon dioxide that's produced",,,
132,It's because it's getting stuffy,,,
133,It's because the air gets muddy,,,
134,It's because we're running out of oxygen,,,
135,There's a lot of air in my body,,,
136,"Oxygen is gone, carbon dioxide is full",,,
137,It's because I keep breathing.,,,
138,The oxygen inside is reduced,,,
139,lack of oxygen,,,
140,Because the breathing space is filled with carbon dioxide (you need oxygen when you breathe),,,
141,"Since there's less air,",,,
142,Because oxygen is getting less and less,,,
143,"Carbon dioxide comes out when you breathe out, and oxygen comes in when you inhale, so carbon dioxide has a higher ratio than oxygen, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
144,Because oxygen is gone,,,
145,air is gone,,,
146,The air is blocked,,,
147,People can't drink carbon dioxide,,,
148,There's less oxygen and more carbon dioxide,,,
149,This is because the air becomes thinner or oxygen is lost.,,,
150,"This is because when we breathe in, oxygen decreases, and when we breathe out, carbon dioxide comes out!",,,
151,It will be hard to breathe because there is a lot of carbon dioxide coming out of your breath.,,,
152,"We drink oxygen and it's filled with carbon dioxide, so it's going to be hard to rest.",,,
153,"It's full of carbon dioxide, and the clean air disappears",,,
154,"At first, it is easier to breathe because there is more oxygen, but if you breathe several times, there is more carbon dioxide, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
155,"Because of the increase in carbon dioxide,",,,
156,"When the air goes inside and spits out, the air seems to have gone bad.",,,
157,This is because the amount of carbon dioxide has become more than fresh air.,,,
158,This is because carbon dioxide accounts for most of the amount.,,,
159,"Because you breathe in the oxygen in the bag and exhale carbon dioxide, it reduces oxygen and makes it difficult to breathe",,,
160,"When breathing in, inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide when exhaling, because the proportion of oxygen in the bag decreased and carbon dioxide increased as the process was repeated.",,,
161,I'm running out of oxygen,,,
162,It's because the air disappears,,,
163,How would I know that?;,,,
164,It's because my head lacks oxygen.,,,
165,My breathing is so fast,,,
166,"At first, there was less carbon dioxide, but later, there was more carbon dioxide",,,
167,"When breathing, 21% of oxygen in the atmosphere and 0.03% of carbon dioxide are consumed, and 16% of oxygen and 4% of carbon dioxide are emitted, making it difficult to breathe because the amount of carbon dioxide in the bag increases.",,,
168,This is because oxygen has decreased and carbon dioxide has increased.,,,
169,"Due to breathing, the concentration of oxygen is lower and the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher than that of exhalation, so the more the air in the plastic bag breathes, the less oxygen concentration decreases, making it difficult to breathe",,,
170,Breathe in with carbon dioxide,,,
171,"This is because oxygen enters the body during inhalation, but carbon dioxide is released during exhalation.",,,
172,I don't know.,,,
173,It's full of carbon dioxide,,,
174,"When you breathe out, there's only carbon dioxide left, not oxygen",,,
175,The air in the bag disappeared,,,
176,"This is because as carbon dioxide increases in plastic bags, oxygen becomes scarce.",,,
177,"Oxygen is inhaled and emitted carbon dioxide, which makes it difficult to breathe due to increased carbon dioxide.",,,
178,Because carbon can't breathe,,,
179,I think it's because of carbon dioxide.,,,
180,"Breathe in oxygen when inhaling, but breathe out carbon dioxide when exhaling, so if you breathe in and out several times, there is not much oxygen left, making it difficult to breathe.",,,
181,The air turns into carbon dioxide,,,
182,The air outside is stuffy. Because the fine dust is severe these days.,,,
183,Because it was filled with the air of exhalation,,,
184,This is because oxygen disappears and carbon dioxide is present.,,,
185,There's a lot of carbon dioxide,,,
186,It is because oxygen is gone.,,,
187,"When you breathe in, the air escapes",,,
188,The oxygen in the bag is gradually disappearing,,,
189,It's made of carbon dioxide,,,
190,I'm drinking carbon dioxide,,,
191,It's because the amount of air decreases when you inhale and exhale,,,
192,Because oxygen became carbon dioxide.,,,
193,"Even if you breathe out and breathe again, there's less air in the bag,",,,
194,This is because the air escapes by inhaling and exhaling the same air.,,,
195,"Because the air has decreased,",,,
196,It's because I drank oxygen and it decreased,,,
197,"""At first, there was only oxygen in the bag, but as I exhaled, carbon dioxide was in the bagIt's harder to breathe because it's more than oxygen """,,,
198,It is because there is less volume to breathe air,,,
199,"The first air in the plastic bag was oxygen, so I could breathe, but after a few breaths, it would have been difficult to breathe because the air in the plastic bag turned into carbon dioxide.",,,
200,Because I exhaled carbon dioxide from my mouth and inhaled it as it was.,,,

206,It's because the air decreases every time you breathe,,,
207,This is because the ratio of air has decreased and the ratio of carbon dioxide has increased.,,,
208,"At first, there was enough oxygen, but carbon dioxide increased instead of oxygen while breathing.",,,
209,This is because the air became warm while breathing in an enclosed place.,,,
210,Because there is no more oxygen to drink and only carbon dioxide exists,,,
211,Because oxygen disappears in the plastic bag,,,
212,This is because the percentage of carbon dioxide increases because carbon dioxide comes out when you inhale and exhale,,,
213,There's not enough carbon dioxide,,,
214,"The carbon dioxide that you exhaled remains in the bag, so you drink carbon dioxide, and as a result, you run out of oxygen, making it difficult.",,,
215,"People breathe oxygen, but if they breathe many times, they breathe carbon dioxide.",,,
216,This is because the oxygen in the bag gradually disappears as it breathes several times.,,,
217,"Because of the increased lung capacity,",,,
218,"Because it is contained in a bag, new air enters and the air inside does not circulate well.",,,
219,I'm running out of oxygen in the air,,,
220,All the oxygen is gone,,,
221,Oxygen is converted into carbon dioxide,,,
222,The carbon dioxide fills the bag,,,

317,"This is because the air in the bag was initially oxygen, but after doing it several times, it turned into carbon dioxide.",,,
318,Because of the reduced air.,,,
319,It may be because there is not much oxygen and there is a lot of carbon dioxide left.,,,
320,"When you breathe in and spit out air, it turns into carbon dioxide",,,
321,"This is because there is more air than average, so it takes more time for oxygen to move.",,,
322,It was because there was a lack of oxygen.,,,
323,"When breathing in and out in a dense space, you can rest because carbon dioxide is not generated yet the first few times, but after that, carbon dioxide is generated due to inhalation and exhalation, making it difficult to breathe.",,,

1107,"Oxygen is consumed during breathing and carbon dioxide is emitted, so oxygen in the plastic bag gradually decreases during repeated inhalation and exhalation.",,,
1108,"Because if you exhale air, it increases the amount of carbon dioxide, and if you go through this process several times, it decreases the amount of oxygen that humans need to breathe",,,
1109,"People breathe and breathe out carbon dioxide with small things, but after many times, it is hard to breathe because there is more carbon dioxide and less oxygen when air movement is not between the outside and the plastic bag",,,
1110,"They breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide, but they lose oxygen",,,
1111,"The partial pressure of oxygen is lowered, so diffusion does not occur well.",,,
1112,"As oxygen is used to breathe and the carbon dioxide ratio increases, the amount of oxygen decreases, making it difficult to rest.",,,
1113,"Inhalation requires oxygen, but the oxygen concentration in the bag gradually decreases",,,
1114,"Since the oxygen concentration is low and gas exchange is not active,",,,
1115,"Because the oxygen concentration went down and the carbon dioxide concentration went up,",,,
1116,The oxygen ratio decreases.,,,
1117,The oxygen content in the air has decreased,,,
1118,This is because the air has become almost lean and carbon dioxide has accumulated instead of oxygen.,,,
1119,"It's not oxygen, it's carbon dioxide",,,
1120,The oxygen in the bag is gradually decreasing.,,,
1121,I'm running low on oxygen,,,
1122,Because we're running out of oxygen,,,
1123,Please come to Cheongsil and Hongsil,,,
1124,I'm tired,,,
1125,Because the air is all turned into carbon dioxide,,,
1126,This is because the air is gone and only carbon dioxide remains.,,,
1127,"Because of carbon dioxide, we breathe with oxygen.",,,
1128,It's because oxygen disappears,,,
1129,be caused by smoking,,,
1130,L.,,,
1131,"When you breathe, you lose oxygen and you get more carbon dioxide",,,
1132,This is because oxygen has decreased.,,,
1133,"There's no oxygen, there's only carbon dioxide",,,
1134,This is because I drank all the oxygen inside and carbon dioxide increased.,,,
1135,This is because they breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.,,,
1136,"Because the oxygen in the bag is converted to carbon dioxide, and I don't have enough oxygen to breathe",,,
1137,It's because there's a lot of carbon dioxide,,,
1138,be due to the escape of air,,,
1139,I don't know,,,
1140,It's carbon dioxide,,,
1141,I don't know,,,
1142,I don't know.,,,
1143,Because oxygen turned into carbon dioxide,,,
1144,I don't know,,,
1145,be due to the coldness of carbon dioxide,,,
1146,This is because there is more carbon dioxide.,,,
1147,Because it exhales carbon dioxide,,,
1148,out of breath,,,
1149,Oxygen is gone and carbon dioxide is formed,,,
1150,"At first, they were able to breathe with the remaining oxygen, but as they breathe in and out, the oxygen turns into carbon dioxide.",,,
1151,I don't know,,,
1152,Because the air is thin.Because of the lack of oxygen.,,,
1153,I don't get oxygen,,,
1154,Because of lack of oxygen,,,
1155,"At first, there was oxygen needed for breathing, but it was because there was less oxygen and more carbon dioxide.",,,
1156,This is because oxygen has decreased and carbon dioxide has increased.,,,
1157,This is because oxygen has decreased and carbon dioxide has increased.,,,
1158,I don't understand.,,,
1159,This is because oxygen has become scarce.,,,
1160,It's because there's a lot of carbon dioxide.,,,
1161,This is because there is less and less air.,,,
1162,Breathe in the air and breathe out carbon dioxide,,,
1163,I don't have enough lung capacity,,,
1164,Because it produces carbon dioxide,,,
1165,I don't drink much,,,
1166,Oxygen is converted into carbon dioxide,,,
1167,"The reason why air remains in the bag when you breathe air for the first few times, but it becomes difficult to breathe after several times is that there is carbon dioxide rather than air in the bag.",,,
1168,I think it is because there is little oxygen and a lot of carbon dioxide in the plastic bag I think so,,,
1169,I think so because there is little oxygen and a lot of carbon dioxide in the plastic bag.,,,
1170,"It will be because there is little oxygen in the plastic bag and there is a lot of carbon dioxide, so I would amortize it",,,
1171,I drank all the air inside,,,
1172,This is because there is no oxygen in the plastic bag and it is full of carbon dioxide because it takes in oxygen while inhaling and re-exits carbon dioxide while exhaling,,,
1173,"""It's low on oxygen and it's full of carbon dioxide",,,
1174,"I can't breathe well because it's full of carbon dioxide.""",,,
1175,"It's because there's a lack of oxygen and it's full of carbon dioxide, and it emits more carbon dioxide than the oxygen I'm trying to drink, so oxygen disappears and it's full of carbon dioxide",,,
1176,The amount of oxygen has decreased,,,
1177,"This is because the first few times I breathe air, it is comfortable because there is enough air, but after that, the amount of air decreases and the carbon dioxide I emit increases.",,,
1178,I don't breathe air,,,
1179,I think it's because of the lack of air.,,,
1180,I don't know.,,,
1181,"Since the oxygen in the bag was used as cellular respiration, carbon dioxide was released, and oxygen for cellular respiration disappeared.",,,
1182,"At first, there was a lot of air in the bag of snacks, but the more you inhale, the less air there is.",,,
1183,"There was a lot of air at first, but it got smaller",,,
1184,It's because of carbon dioxide,,,
1185,It is the same as the above answer.,,,
1186,The air is gone,,,
1187,"Oxygen disappeared,You have to breathe in oxygen, but it's hard because it shrinks",,,
1188,I'm out of breath,,,
1189,It is because a lot of the air in the bag disappeared.,,,
1190,It took time for my heart to come back,,,
1191,Because the amount of air in the bag is fixed.,,,
1192,Because breathing eliminates oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide,,,
1193,I don't know.,,,
1194,The air got soggy,,,
1195,Because I was out of breath.,,,
1196,"I need to breathe with oxygen, but there's no more",,,
1197,This is because oxygen becomes scarce.,,,
1198,"Oxygen is consumed by drinking, but carbon dioxide is exhaled and produced continuously",,,
1199,This is because breathing becomes more difficult as the ratio of carbon dioxide is higher than that of oxygen,,,
1200,"At first, the bag was filled with oxygen, but later, it is difficult to breathe because there is no oxygen and carbon dioxide is full.",,,
1201,"I think there is more carbon dioxide in the air than oxygen, but maybe not.",,,
1202,I'm out of breath and I'm going to have a hard time breathing,,,
1203,This is because the amount of carbon dioxide increased and the amount of oxygen decreased.,,,
1204,"As you continue to inhale and exhale air, the air accumulated in it gradually increases, and the air that you can breathe gradually decreases.",,,
1205,"When you drink, you drink oxygen, but when you spit it out, there is no more oxygen to drink",,,
1206,Because oxygen disappears quickly,,,
1207,because of lack of oxygen,,,
1208,This is because oxygen becomes scarce.,,,
1209,It's full inside,,,
1210,Co2 is getting higher,,,
1211,"This is because at first, there was more oxygen than the amount of carbon dioxide.",,,
1212,There's a lot of carbon dioxide,,,
1213,There's more carbon dioxide than oxygen,,,
1214,Oxygen is thin,,,
1215,"At first, the amount of carbon dioxide was small, but the amount of carbon dioxide we exhaled is contained in our daily breath, making it difficult to breathe after several breaths.",,,
1216,"At first, there is oxygen, but as you rest for a long time, there is more carbon dioxide.",,,
