If the amount of salt is divided by the amount of solution, the answer is in the form of free water in which the amount of salt in the solution is less than 1 and greater than 0. Therefore, the larger these values, the greater the intensity of salt water, and the smaller the value, the smaller the intensity of salt water. The second method is to compare the amount of salt produced by adjusting the amount of water in a, b, and c beaker to the same temperature. A degree to which a solute is dissolved in the solution is proportional to the temperature and the amount of the solution, so if the amount of the solution is the same and the temperature is cooled, salt is deposited in a supersaturated state. The higher the amount of salt deposited here, the more salt is contained in the solution, and the thicker the salt water is.",,,,,

In addition, the concentration of salt water can be compared by evaporating all of the water from the A, B, and C beakers and comparing the amount of salt remaining at the end. Finally, the current flows through the A, B, and C beakers and compares the strength of the current. Salt is an electrolyte, so the more it melts, the stronger the current will flow.",,,,,

852,"First of all, it can be used that the density varies depending on the concentration. Therefore, you can put boiled eggs in salt water and compare them to the height at which the eggs are floating. Second, it can be compared through osmotic pressure depending on the concentration. Put the osmotic membrane in the U-shaped tube, and put different solutions on both sides.
