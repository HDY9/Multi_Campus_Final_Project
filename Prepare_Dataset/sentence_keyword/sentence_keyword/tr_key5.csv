780,"Sweat prevents the skin from drying along with sebum, maintains the surface normal, and regulates the body temperature by dissipating evaporation heat. The secretion of sweat is 600~700m?áµ?áµ?á¡??per day, but it can be up to 10?á¡?áµ?á© during summer or exercise. Fever is classified into warm and psychotic sweating according to its cause. Thermal sweating is sweat that is involved in body temperature control, which occurs when the temperature is high or when a lot of heat is generated by muscle exercise. This cold comes from the whole body other than the palm and sole of the foot. Mental sweating is perspiration that occurs when you are moved, and appears only in the palm, soles of your feet, and armpits. When you're nervous, the word ""sweat in your hand"" means mental sweating. There is a habit of painting saliva on the hands when performing certain movements, and similarly, mental sweating has a biological meaning that it facilitates the movement of the hands and feet by moisturizing the palms and feet.",,

952,"The liquid sweat evaporates into the air over time and disappears. The change of a liquid substance into a gaseous state is called vaporization. Since gaseous substances have more energy than liquid substances, liquid substances need to absorb heat from their surroundings to obtain energy to become gaseous substances.
