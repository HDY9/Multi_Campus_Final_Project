,"10. The Earth is known to spin itself along its axis of rotation. This phenomenon is called the rotation of the Earth, and what are some of the natural phenomena that occur in the rotation of the Earth?

819,"Because the Earth rotates, day and night occur due to the difference between the side facing the sun and the other side facing the sun. In addition, due to the rotation of the Earth, large air convection from the equator to the poles receives a forward force and divides directions, resulting in westerlies and trade winds.",,,,,
820,"Night and night occur (exceptions, of course)",,,,,

822,I don't know,,,,,
823,Day and night are created by the rotation of the earth. And then you have Coriholipos.,,,,,
824,a daily temperature difference,,,,,
825,"The earth rotates and becomes an acceleration coordinate system, which creates various inertial forces. Assuming that angular velocity is constant, the inertial force produces coriolis and centripetal force, the former prevents the bullet we shoot straight from going straight, the latter makes us feel less gravity than the actual gravity, and the equator is slightly protruding. And by rotating, the metal part of the outer core will rotate, which will help to form a magnetic field.",,,,,
826,By rotation the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.,,,,,
827,Ebb and flood tide,,,,,

829,Coriolis ' force day and night. The wind currents.,,,,,
830,Will have a day and night.,,,,,
831,"Day and night is generated. Tilted 23.5 degrees that revolved around its rotation, during which they a area causes day, looking at the sun at noon. On the contrary, 22 remain far from the sun at night if you get.",,,,,
832,"A day and night due to the rotation of the earth. Coriolis ' force, which result from the virtual power in the rotation of the earth, atmospheric circulation is complex due to happen. As a result, various orientation, windy and it is of the nature and currents affecting the overall energy circulation is of the Earth.",,,,,
