0,It uses natural energy that doesn't disappear,,
1,Because it is electricity production using nature.,,
2,"Fossil energy such as coal and oil can be lost, but sunlight is not lost",,
3,The sun is shining,,
4,Hmm... Oh!  The sun shines to help,,
5,Because we can make energy continuously,,
6,Because there is energy???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,,
7,Solar power becomes stronger.,,
8,It gives you a hard time.,,
9,Because the sun is not limited energy like oil and fossils.,,
10,at a low cost of electricity,,
11,Because of the energy wake up,,
12,environmental protection,,
13,It is easier and easier to obtain than fossil energy such as coal and oil without polluting the environment.,,
14,Because we can make electricity from the sun,,
15,It reflects sunlight and uses less electricity,,
16,"There may be no coal or heavy oil in the future, so we need it",,
17,The sun makes the rent less expensive,,
18,I'm not sure if I'm going to use a lot of energy from the sun,,
19,You can make your head go up without having a limitless.,,
20,Because resources are infinite and do not emit other pollutants.,,
21,Because coal or oil is not very good.,,
22,They make electricity from the sun,,
23,They make electricity from the sun,,
24,Because solar energy can be produced indefinitely.,,
25,Because we don't use our resources,,
26,To save money,,
27,To save money,,
28,I'm trying to save money by not using expensive oil,,
29,It can save energy and prevent pollution.,,
30,I don't know.,,
31,"Oil and coal are limited, but solar energy is steady",,
32,It creates energy only with the power of nature,,
33,"This is because fossil energy is finite, but sunlight is almost infinite.",,
34,It's eco-friendly and doesn't pollute the environment,,
35,It generates electricity through the power of sunlight.,,
36,A car can travel for a long time,,
37,"Coal and fossils are environments that will one day disappear, but the sun will not disappear in the future",,
38,You can do it indefinitely,,
39,This is because it causes less damage to nature. And because the sun can be used for a very long time to come.,,
40,Because coal and oil are needed to bake this food,,
41,"Coal and oil pollute the environment, and solar power is basically made using sunlight, so it is not environmental pollution",,
42,Because the sun doesn't disappear.,,
43,"There are many villages in the countryside where light does not work well, because solar power can create light.",,
44,"There are many villages in the countryside where light does not work well, because it can make light for solar power generation.",,

77,an infinite source of energy,,
78,"This is because the use of solar energy, which can be used infinitely in preparation for the shrinking fossil energy in the future, can prepare for environmental pollution or depleted resources.",,
79,"Unlike coal and petroleum, which decrease as you use it, solar energy from the sun is energy that does not disappear no matter how much you use it.",,
80,"Coal and oil reserves are limited, but solar power can be permanently generated, which helps sustainable development for the future.",,
81,"In addition, coal or oil is the main culprit of destroying the ozone layer and causing global warming, resulting in various environmental destruction problems. However, because solar power is eco-friendly, it helps sustainable power generation.""",,
82,"This is because solar energy can be used as long as the sun does not dissipate, so there is less risk of depletion than fossil energy.",,
83,"Fossil energy such as coal and oil converts energy and has a bad effect on global warming such as carbon dioxide, but solar power does not produce such bad substances, which helps sustainable development.",,
84,"Because fossil fuels are limited in quantity, whereas sunlight is not limited in quantity",,
85,"Fossil energy, such as coal, petroleum, etc., generates pollutants such as carbon dioxide, global warming, environmental pollution, and limited reserves so that it can be used semi-permanently as long as the sun exists and does not generate pollutants.",,
86,"This is because resources are infinite compared to fossil energy with limited reserves without emitting carbon dioxide or pollutants that cause global warming, so it can be sustainable.",,
87,"The reason is that solar power uses nature to produce energy that can be produced indefinitely. In the case of coal and oil, not only the reserves themselves are greatly limited, but also environmental pollution caused by the generation of carbon dioxide. Thus, unlimited, environmentally friendly solar power energy helps sustainable development in the future.",,
88,"In the case of fossil energy such as coal and petroleum, environmental pollution occurs, such as emitting various pollutants during the production process. On the other hand, in the case of solar power generation, eco-friendly energy that does not emit pollutants is produced in the process of generating energy, which helps sustainable development for the future.",,
89,.,,
90,Coal and oil are easily depleted because of limited amounts.,,
91,"And, heating coal to make energy creates carbon dioxide, which can cause global warming. On the contrary, solar power generation can generate energy without causing negative consequences such as pollution, so it can be regarded as an eco-friendly and future-oriented technology.""",,
92,"No matter how much coal or oil is buried in the Arctic Ocean or Antarctica, and ""a lot"" is buried in the Middle East, so there is an inevitable limit. There is also a limit to infinitely satisfying the human desire to spend 80 million barrels of oil every day. It also emits greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide through the combustion of fossil fuels, which have a greenhouse effect on the Earth's atmosphere. And the average temperature of the Earth is bound to rise because the solar radiation energy coming in from the Earth is absorbed more and the energy released is reduced. However, sustainable development, such as fossil fuels mentioned above, has limitations or does not cause environmental pollution, so sustainable development helps the Earth, us, and the future.",,
93,be free of greenhouse gases,,
94,.,,
95,"Fossil energy such as coal and oil has a greenhouse effect in the process of power generation, accelerating global warming. However, solar power does not generate a greenhouse effect in the process of power generation, and the energy source is the light of the sun, so as long as the sun exists, it can generate energy for a long time longer than the survival of mankind.",,
96,This is because solar tube power generation energy can be used permanently because it can be regenerated as long as the sun does not disappear.,,
97,"Fossil energy, such as coal and oil, pollutes the environment, but solar power does not pollute the environment.",,
98,"HelloThis is because the sun still has 4.5 billion years of life left, so it can provide infinite power.",,
99,"Fossil energy such as coal and oil will be used, and the amount will gradually decrease, raising prices and eventually disappearing. Solar power generation is not much different from the use of fossil energy due to its high installation cost, but as technology develops, the initial cost decreases and solar energy can be used semi-permanently, so sustainable development can be made in future society.",,
100,"Solar power generation can receive unlimited sunlight by installing panels, and the resulting environmental pollution is very small, which will greatly help sustainable power generation.",,
101,"Fossil energy such as coal and oil is obtained by combustion. However, excessive carbon dioxide is emitted through the process of combustion, which strengthens the greenhouse effect, causing global environmental problems such as global warming. However, solar energy can be said to be eco-friendly energy because it uses the natural energy of the sun to obtain energy through power generation that does not require combustion. Therefore, solar power can be said to be helpful for sustainable power generation compared to fossil energy.",,

When global warming occurs, global damage is caused by rising sea levels due to rising Earth's average temperature, Eligno and Lanninha, early summer and winter, etc. In addition, the amount of fossil fuels buried in the Earth is limited, so if they continue to be used, there will be a problem of depletion someday in the distant future. These limitations and problems show that it is difficult to produce sustainable power generation and growth by producing energy only with fossil fuels. In contrast, renewable energy is eco-friendly energy without emitting greenhouse gases in the process of obtaining energy.
