This is because there are already many hydrogen ions in the solution. However, if a basic substance is added to the solution little by little, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution decreases, so that the hydrogen attached to the indicator is dissociated and the number of molecules present in an ionic state increases. As the acidity of the solution changes, the number of indicator molecules whose molecular structure changes increases, and the color of the molecule changes as the molecular structure changes.

781,I don't understand.,,,,
782,I don't know.,,,,
783,...,,,,
784,Because they lose their respective properties,,,,
785,The strong two acids and bases meet and weaken.,,,,
786,It's because it's the opposite.,,,,
787,Acid decay in other things weakens.,,,,
788,"Because acidity and basicity are opposite substances, they weaken each other when they meet each other.",,,,
789,I don't know,,,,
790,This is because they have different properties.,,,,
791,I don't know,,,,
792,"Both properties weaken because H+ from the acid binds back to the base, or OH- from the base and H+ from the acid combine to form H2O, or neutral substances.The acid produces H+ and the base combines it with H2O because it produces OH-.",,,,
793,"Acids and bases react and neutralize. As a result, the concentration is lowered, so the acidity and basicity are weakened.",,,,
794,This is because H+ ions and OH- ions meet to become H2O (neutral).,,,,
795,offset by neutralization,,,,
796,become H+ + OH- -> H2O and neutralize.,,,,
797,H+ ions and OH- ions meet to become H2O.,,,,
798,"Because of the neutralization of acids and bases,",,,,
799,buffering action,,,,
800,"Since the acid is H+ and the base is OH-, H3o+ + OH- -> 2H2O becomes neutral.",,,,
801,"Acid H+ and basic OH- meet to become H2O, weakening the acidity and basicity.",,,,
802,Since H3O+ + OH- -> 2H2O,,,,
803,This is because a neutralization reaction occurs.,,,,
804,I don't know,,,,
805,Acids and bases weaken when they meet,,,,
806,"They are opposite each other, so when they meet, they get rid of each other and become weak.",,,,
807,It's neutralizing,,,,
808,"There is a neutrality between acids and bases Therefore, the acidity weakens when you put it in the acid, and vice versa",,,,
809,"This is because when acidity and basicity are mixed, they become neutral.",,,,
810,have no knowledge,,,,
811,I don't know,,,,
812,I don't know.,,,,
813,neutrality,,,,
814,You two are in sync,,,,
815,It's a basic ingredient that weakens the acidity.,,,,
816,"When acidity and basicity meet, the acidity and basicity weaken because they are close to neutral.",,,,
817,I don't know.,,,,
818,Neutral neutral hehehe,,,,
819,This is because it represents neutrality.,,,,
820,"Since the ratio of the acid to the base becomes neutral when it is met, the acid and base become neutral as they become closer to the neutral, decreasing the acidity and base",,,,
821,The acid is red and the base is blue,,,,
822,be due to neutrality,,,,
823,"This is because when acidity and basicity meet, they try to become neutral.",,,,
824,"Because it's opposite, it's getting closer to neutrality",,,,
825,"Acids and bases have opposite properties, so when they meet, they become neutral",,,,
826,This is because acidity and basicity are contrasting properties.,,,,
827,Acid and basicity lower each other's temperature when they meet each other,,,,
828,I just did the experiment and forgot the results,,,,
829,"Acid and basicity exhibit opposite properties, so when acidity and basicity meet, they become neutral.",,,,
830,"Because acidity and basicity have opposite properties, they weaken each other when they meet.",,,,
831,"When acidic and basic are mixed, they turn into neutral substances and lose their acidic and basic properties.",,,,
832,Don't know,,,,
833,?,,,,
834,I don't know,,,,
835,It's going to explode,,,,
836,#NAME?,,,,
837,Acid and oxygen bases are basic,,,,
838,Acid wins Uncertain.,,,,
839,"When there's a fire, it'",,,,
840,Because the two Hanseong meet together,,,,
841,This is because the two are mixed and neutralized.,,,,
842,"There's something acidic and basic, but if you mix it up, you can't do it right?",,,,
843,"This is because when acidity and basicity meet, the components evaporate.",,,,
844,It's mixed and neutralized,,,,
845,This is the same reason why some foods are sprayed with lemon to catch the smell,,,,
846,"As strong forces collide with each other, they become weaker and weaker.",,,,
847,"When acidic or basic acidity is added to the acidity, it causes a neutralization reaction, weakening the acidity, and weakening the basicity.",,,,
848,"When an acid meets a base, the acidity and basicity are weakened by a neutralization reaction.",,,,
849,"This is because if you put basic substances in an acidic substance, the acidity weakens",,,,
850,"This is because when basic substances are added to acidic substances, a neutralization reaction occurs, in which the acidity weakens.",,,,
851,Acids and bases decay by neutralization,,,,
852,"According to the Bronsted Lowry base, acids release hydrogen ions and bases release hydroxide ions. When an acid and a base meet, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions meet to create water, which causes a neutralization reaction. As a result, acidity and basicity are weakened.",,,,
853,Acid and basicity weaken because a neutralization reaction occurs when an acid meets a base.,,,,
854,Acid and basicity weaken because a neutralization reaction occurs when an acid meets a base.,,,,
855,Because acids and bases neutralize when they meet.,,,,
856,"Acid means pH less than 7 and basic means more than 7, which is the -log [H+] The more hydrogen ions, the more acidic they are, and the less hydrogen ions, the more basic they are. When acidity and basicity meet, the ions are reduced or increased in concentration of hydrogen ions through chemical reactions, which are different from their original values.",,,,
857,Neutralized by neutralization.,,,,
858,I don't know,,,,
859,Each property is weakened by acid base neutralization because acids and bases try to mix when they meet each other.,,,,
860,"When acidity and basicity are mixed, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions meet to form water, which lowers the concentration of hydrogen ions and increases the pH",,,,
861,"Acid is low in pH and basic is high in pH, because when the two meet, a neutralization reaction occurs.",,,,
862,"Acidic substances emit hydrogen ions, and basic substances receive hydrogen ions. When the two meet, a neutralization reaction occurs, which weakens each other's properties.",,,,
863,I don't know,,,,
864,"The H+ and OH- amounts in the solution distinguish between acids and bases and determine their strength. If the number is low based on the neutral pH 7, it is called basic if the acid is high, where pH means -log[H+], so the higher the hydrogen ions, the lower the pH value. When H+ and OH- meet, water-producing reactions occur, so when acidity and basicity are mixed, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in each solution combine with water, weakening the acidity and basicity.",,,,
865,I don't know,,,,
866,I don't know,,,,
867,I don't know,,,,
868,I don't understand.,,,,
869,"Acid and basicity react with each other through a neutralization reaction to create a neutral molecule called water, which weakens the acidity and basicity.",,,,
870,"If you think that acidic basicity will be divided by H+ OH-ions because it is a solution, adding an acidic solution and basic solution weakens the acidic basicity as the two ions meet to produce water.",,,,
871,"Acid has the property of releasing H+, and basic has the tongue that absorbs H+. Therefore, when basic and acidic meet, the pH changes because the concentration of H+ changes.",,,,
872,I don't know,,,,
873,I don't know,,,,
874,Hydrogen ions of the neutralization reaction acid and hydroxyl ions of the base meet to become water,,,,
