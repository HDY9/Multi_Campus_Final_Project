98,"Water is sucked from the roots, the water goes through the water pipe to the leaves, carbon dioxide is introduced through breathing, and the leaves react water and carbon dioxide with sunlight to make glucose and oxygen. The glucose clumps into starch.Plants make nutrients through photosynthesis. Water molecules and carbon dioxide molecules are recombined through solar energy to produce glucose. Therefore, plants need water, carbon dioxide, and solar energy to produce their own nutrients.",,,,,,,
