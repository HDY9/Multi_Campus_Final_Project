867,"The reason why the c beaker does not dissolve well is that the solution is saturated with a lot of salt. The degree to which the solute dissolves in the solution is proportional to the amount of the solution and the temperature of the solution. In other words, the salt did not dissolve in the c beaker because the amount of the solution was too small or the temperature of the solution was too cold. Therefore, in the above situation, since salt is a solute and water is a solution, there is a method of adding more water to the c beaker or heating the c beaker using an alcohol lamp to increase the temperature of the water in the c beaker.",,,
868,"In order to increase the amount of dissolved salt, you can increase the amount of liquid. Each liquid has a set amount that can be dissolved, and if you increase the amount of liquid, of course, the amount that can be dissolved increases, so you can dissolve all the salt. You can also increase the temperature of the liquid. The amount of dissolution increases as the temperature increases. I think that as the temperature goes up, the volume of the object goes up, and by doing so, we can melt more. Also, I think salt will melt a lot even if the pressure is lowered. This is because lowering the pressure increases the volume.",,,
869,"As the amount of solvent increases, the amount of solute that can be included also increases. Therefore, water is added to increase the amount of water or evaporated to reduce the amount of water.  In addition, as the temperature of the solvent increases, the amount of solute that may be included increases. So it increases the temperature of the solvent.",,,
870,"First, increase the amount of water. It is called solubility, which is the amount of solute that a certain amount can be dissolved in a solvent to the maximum. In this case, it can be seen that the ne is supersaturated, which means that the supersaturated state does not dissolve due to the presence of a larger amount of solute than the appropriate solubility. Since the solubility is an amount of solute/an amount of solvent x 100, salt is removed or water as a solvent is added to reduce the solubility.",,,
871,"There are two different ways to dissolve salt that has not been dissolved in the C beaker, which can be explained using solubility.  First, add a lot of water. Solubility is because the more substance dissolves, the better it dissolves. Secondly, you can raise the temperature. This is because solubility increases as the temperature increases.",,,
872,"To dissolve all the salt in the C beaker, increase the amount of water or increase the temperature. The reason why all salts of the C beaker are not dissolved is that water has become a saturated solution, and to further dissolve the solute in the saturated solution, the amount of solvent or the temperature of the solution must be increased.",,,
873,"The way to dissolve all the salt that has not been dissolved in the C beaker is to melt it by applying heat to the beaker, and to dissolve the salt that is a solute with more water as a solvent.",,,
874,"The reason why the salt was not completely dissolved in the C beaker was that a larger amount of salt was supplied than the solubility. Therefore, the solubility must be increased to dissolve all the salt that has not been dissolved. In order to increase the solubility of the solid, the c beaker must be heated to increase the temperature or pressure.",,,
