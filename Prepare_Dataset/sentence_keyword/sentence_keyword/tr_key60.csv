,"5. If you observe conch, the shape of conch shell is slightly different. A conch that lives in a place with strong currents has developed horns on its shell, so it is not easily washed away by water, but a conch that lives in a place where the current is not strong has no horns on its shell. What is the reason?",q60_water current ,q60_depending on the ,q60_environment

6,I don't know.,,,
7,hohoh,,,
8,I'm going to hang in there,,,
9,The shape of the conch was changed naturally so that it could withstand high currents,,,
10,Because the shell was changed by the current.,,,

34,"The conch in the place where the current is strong changed to adapt to it, but the place where the current is weak did not change because the current was not strong.",,,
35,The place where the current is strong seems to have horns because the shell day of the conch is cut.,,,
36,"The conch with strong currents has roots on it, so it does not leave even if the waves come, and the conch with weak currents has no horns on it, so it is well floated by the waves.",,,

53,The first conch was cut off by a strong current and shaped like that.,,,
54,The current creates horns,,,
55,This is because you have to fix it with a horn in order not to drift away from a strong current.,,,
56,"It has a pointed shape to prevent the current from being washed away or eaten by other sea creatures because it is strong, and it does not have a pointed shape because the water is less pushed down",,,

579,It is because the environment of living is different and the conch that lives in a place where the current is weak is not swept away by the current even if it does not have horns,,,
580,"""Depending on where you grew up,",,,
581,"It evolves, and the shape, the food, or the living environment",,,

584,"Sora live by sticking to rocks, but in places with strong currents, there are more other life forms than in places with weaker currents, so they are not swept away by them.",,,
585,"Sora, which is located in a place where the current is strong, develops horns because the current cuts the conch and weathering occurs. Therefore, it does not float easily in the water, but if the current is weak, the weathering effect occurs weakly, so it is round.",,,
586,"The horned conch has many sides that touch it, so it becomes resistant. The area of conch in the place where the current is weak is smaller than that of conch in the place where the current is strong. Therefore, the shell of a conch has horns to suit the environment because of its more frictional force.",,,
587,"Sora, which lives in a place with strong currents, must have developed horns to put them on the floor or around it and not drift away by strong currents. Sora in places with weak currents have not developed horns because there is little danger of being washed away. Depending on the difference in the environment, they are adapting to different shapes and living.",,,
588,The place where the current is weak seems to have no horns because the conch flows comfortably without much interference from the water,,,
589,"Just as people live by adapting to a new environment, Sora also changed her body to adapt to her environment. The shape of each other is different because strong currents are easy to float away in water, so that horns are developed and resistant to water so that they do not drift well, and weak currents do not have to develop horns because they are not strong.",,,
590,"If the current is not strong, it is less resistant, so the conch does not need to have a horn, so it will degenerate even if it does not have or has. However, the conch in the place where the current is strong is resistant to the current a lot, so it is to settle in one place (stop) as much as possible with horns on the shell of the conch.",,,
591,Sora's survival instinct?,,,
592,It is to adapt to where each person lives and live better.,,,
593,"Sora living in high-flow areas should be prevented from being pushed away by increasing their resistance to water, but Sora living in uncounted areas do not have to, so they exist in a form suitable for the environment.Living things adapt to their environment in order to survive. That's why conch living in places with weak currents has little risk of leaving, while conch living in places with strong currents has a high risk of leaving, so horns have developed to prevent this and fix it to the ground to withstand strong currents.",,,
594,"""The reason why the shell of a conch is sharp is because of the shell facing the current",,,
595,"This is to reduce the surface area so that it receives less resistance. But the conch in a place where the current is weak,",,,
596,"Even if the skin is not sharp, it doesn't float away easily, so the skin doesn't have to go in a sharp direction",,,
597,"It doesn't evolve.""",,,
598,"The conch originally had different shapes for each individual. There must have been horny conch and hornless conch everywhere. However, over time, only horned conch survived in places with strong currents, and only hornless conch survived in places with weak currents, and the genotypes of this shape were passed down to descendants, leading to this division today.",,,
599,"""In the beginning, there must have been some cows with developed horns on their shells, whether they were those with strong currents or those with weak currents. However, the number of conch without horns on its shell would have decreased due to its disadvantage in survival because it was easily washed away by water, which has a strong current, and conch with developed horns would have survived for a long time.",,,

601,"In places with strong currents, conch is easy to fall off even if it is attached to a rock.The change in the shell shape of a conch is also said to have changed to the most suitable condition to survive by adapting to the environment, but the reason why the shape of the shell is horny in a place with strong currents is to withstand the current better by being caught between rocks.However, in places where the current is weak, it is not horny because it does not have to be.",,,
602,"The reason why each conch looks different is that it has been grown in a different environment. In places where the current is strong, the horn is developed so that oxygen does not easily drift away, but there is no reason to have horns because it is rare for a cow to drift away in places where the current is not strong.",,,
603,The horn interferes with the flow of water,,,
604,It's because of erosion.,,,
605,"The place where the current is affected by the current changes to be smooth, and the place where the current is weak is relatively soft",,,
606,Cows with strong currents have evolved to suit each environment.,,,

608,"On the other hand, it is not necessary to fix it in places where the current is weak.""",,,
609,It's supposed to be on the ground so it doesn't float away,,,

617,"If the current is strong, conch can be swept away by the water and go downstream of the river, but if there is a horn, it is caught in the surrounding terrain and does not move well. If the current is weak, the horn is not necessary because it is not swept away by the water.",,,
618,Because of the erosion caused by water,,,
619,This is because they evolve differently depending on the environment in which they live.,,,

622,"If the current is strong, the skin must be strong to live, and if the current is weak, the skin can live even if the skin is weak.",,,
623,"Zada's erosion occurred, and the swells in the strong current were cut by the current.",,,
624,"Water can cut stone in half. A place with a strong current like this has a strong water strength, making it a shape of a conch. On the other hand, if the current is weak, it looks like this to conch",,,
625,"The conch in the place where the current is strong is made to prevent it from being washed away by a powerful current, but the conch in the place where the current is weak is not washed away by the current, so there is no need for the horn to develop.",,,
626,"It's because it's fixed on the floor in a place where the current is strong, so that it can reproduce without being easily",,,
627,The conch in the strong current seems to be the result of adapting the conch not to be swept away by the current.,,,
628,This is because conch living in a place with strong currents adapted through its horns.,,,
629,This is because the horns that provide resistance can withstand the current.,,,
630,"Sora, which lives in a place with strong currents, developed horns to adapt to the environment, and they were naturally selected and divided into two shapes.",,,
631,"Even if I don't have horns, I don't get washed away",,,

648,The current isn't strong,,,
649,You need a horn to ask the floor without drifting away.,,,
650,"This is because the horn has a larger surface area and the friction is greater, so it does not get swept away from the strong current.",,,

664,"When horns develop, currents pass through the horns and do not drift away.",,,
665,"Even if there is a horn in the place where the current is weak, it does not float well compared to the conch in the place where the current is strong, so it has evolved to have no horn",,,

680,A conch with a strong current is made of horns so that the current does not get caught in its shell too much,,,
681,It is rarely easily swept away by the current.,,,
682,This phenomenon occurred because living things change easily and evolve according to their surroundings.,,,
683,"Sora living in places with strong currents developed horns to avoid being swept away by the current, but Sora in places with weak currents did not develop horns because they were less likely to be swept away by the current.",,,
684,It is to develop rake-like horns so that they do not drift away from the current and stay well attached to the ground.,,,

844,"Because there are things that you need for the environment, and there is nothing that you don'",,,
845,It's changed by adapting to your environment and making it easier to live in,,,
846,"In high-flowing areas, horns have been formed to fix them so as not to drift away",,,
847,Support the body with horns.,,,
848,Don't let the current drift away,,,
849,Mutation,,,
850,You have to protect yourself from strong currents,,,
851,"Where the current is strong, it is pointed to stay between rocks",,,
852,"""If the current is strong, it is easy to sweep away, but if there is a horn in the shell of a conch, it gets caught somewhere and the chances of survival increase.",,,
853,"Conversely, conchs in places with weak currents do not need horns because they do not get swept away.""",,,
854,"In places where the current is strong, the horn has developed to avoid being pushed out of the waves, and in places where the current is weak, the horn has not developed because it is not pushed out by the waves.",,,
855,e,,,
856,"Where the current is strong, it has horns to protect it with its own shell",,,
857,The conch in a strong place is an insider,,,
858,This is because conch lived in different environments and evolved to suit the environment.,,,
859,This is because conch in places with strong currents evolved to develop horns to avoid being washed away by water.,,,
860,"This is because the water flows between the horns, weakening the power of the current",,,
861,This is because conch in places where the current is weak does not have to withstand the pressure of water.,,,
862,This is to not slide down the current.,,,
