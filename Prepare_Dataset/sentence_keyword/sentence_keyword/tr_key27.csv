In order to prepare an inquiry plan, it is necessary to think of the purpose and method of inquiry and to establish an experimental plan, and to investigate the theoretical background. After writing an inquiry plan, you should think about whether it is an experiment that you can actually do through in-depth conversation with your teacher and design an inquiry in a way that reduces trial and error as much as possible. After the exploration design is completed, the actual exploration is carried out. If something goes wrong while exploring, go back to designing the exploration, repeat the above process, and conclude when the exploration is completed well. As a final step, prepare a result report.",,

1102,"The process that should be done immediately after setting the inquiry problem is probably hypothesized. If it is an activity that writes based on a previously proven phenomenon, a hypothesis may not be necessary because a conclusion has already been drawn, but if a new phenomenon is discovered and a conclusion is drawn, a hypothesis is required. After the hypothesis establishment is over, I think the inquiry process can be conducted in the order of establishing a research plan, researching, drawing conclusions, and feedback.",,

The results are checked and analyzed after dividing into a control group that did not change in the pre-experiment state and an experimental group to obtain the experimental results. After that, compared with the hypothesis, if the hypothesis is correct, the conclusion is made as it is, and if the hypothesis is wrong, the conclusion is corrected and then concluded",,

1112,"Rather than taking the fact for granted and passing it over just because it cannot be explained, I think it is worth exploring if you think deeply about why such a phenomenon occurred. Scientists will design experiments or studies in that direction before deciding on a question of inquiry and thinking about how to solve it. If it is finally concluded that the hypothesis is wrong, I think it is the exploration that the scientist should make by constantly researching a new hypothesis and reaching a close conclusion.",,
