1,Because the atmosphere rises under low pressure,,,,
2,"At high pressure, there is a downward airflow to keep the clouds clear",,,,
3,"High pressure lowering airflow, low pressure rising airflow",,,,
4,The low pressure is caused by rising air currents,,,,
5,"This is because water vapor on the surface evaporates into the sky through rising air currents, forming clouds at low pressures",,,,

13,"In the low pressure, a lot of rising air flows occur, so relatively more clouds gather compared to the surrounding area. Therefore, there is a high probability of rain.",,,,
14,This is because rising air currents appear in low pressure.,,,,
15,"In low pressure, air clumps in many directions form a lot of clouds.",,,,
16,It is because clouds form during low pressure.,,,,

26,"If the air pressure is high, a downward airflow is generated, so clouds cannot be generated, and if the air pressure is low, an upward airflow is generated and clouds are generated.",,,,
27,"Because air travels from high pressure to low pressure, there are many wires such as cold front and warm front in low pressure",,,,
