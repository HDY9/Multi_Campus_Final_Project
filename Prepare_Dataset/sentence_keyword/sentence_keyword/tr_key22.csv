911,"When the proportion of water vapor in the cloud is more than 100 percent, it becomes heavy due to cohesion and falls into gravity and becomes rain. At this time, when the temperature below the condensation point is below, a phase change occurs in the snow and falls.",,
912,"When the cloud with condensed water vapor becomes heavy, it falls in snow or rain.",,
913,"The water vapor condenses to form clouds, and if water vapor continues to accumulate in the clouds, it becomes heavy and falls in rain. Or the temperature will be very low temperatures.",,
914,"When the clouds freeze, it becomes snow, and when the snow falls, it melts due to higher temperatures, it becomes rain.",,
915,"Clouds are made of water vapor, and when the amount exceeds a certain amount, it becomes rain, and when the weather is cold, the water vapor freezes to become snow",,
916,"Clouds are in the form of condensation of water vapor, which aggregates into snow or rain.",,
917,"As the air rises, the air pressure decreases, increasing the volume and lowering the temperature, which is called adiabatic expansion. When the temperature decreases to below the dew point due to insulation expansion, water vapor gathers around dust in the atmosphere and clouds are formed. If water vapor continues to clump together in these clouds, in the case of warm clouds, droplets of various sizes collide with each other and merge, and when the size is large enough, they become rain and fall to the ground. When water droplets become water vapor in cold clouds, they stick to the ice lump, and the ice lump grows, and the heavy ice lump comes down to the ground under gravity.",,

919,"When the cloud reaches the condensation point and becomes a heavy drop of water, it falls down This is the form of rain, and if the temperature of the upper floor is below zero during the fall, it becomes snow.",,

923,"When the cloud becomes heavy, it falls to the ground, which becomes rain and snow depending on the weather and temperature. It rains when the weather is warm and snows when it is cold.",,
924,"When the water vapor and water droplets in the cloud meet and grow in size, it falls in rain, and when the temperature around it is low, it becomes snow.",,

931,"Clouds in the sky are lumps of water vapor. When the temperature is low, the water vapor condenses into ice pieces as it rains, and becomes snow. On the other hand, if the temperature is not a temperature to be formed in a solid form, it is rained down.",,
