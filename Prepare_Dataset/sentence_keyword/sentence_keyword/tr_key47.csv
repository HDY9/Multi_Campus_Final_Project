Their apparent brightness is smaller than that of the sun because the brightness of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Therefore, because starlight outside the sun is relatively very dark, our eyes can only see the light emitted from the sun.",
553,"Daytime is due to the fact that the sun illuminates the area, which is located on the horizon when viewed from Earth. When stars are placed on the horizon with the sun, the brightness of the sun is brighter than the brightness of the star, so the star cannot be seen by the sun.",

1091,"This is because the sunlight is relatively too strong. For us, low means that the surface of the Earth where we live is facing the sun. So the night, on the contrary, means that the Earth's surface is facing the opposite of the sun. In the case of night, stars can shine because the sun is not facing the earth's surface, but as I said earlier, the sun's light is stronger during the day, so it can be said that the star's light is hidden.",
1092,"Even during the day, stars are floating in the sky, but the light emitted by the sun is too bright to cover the light of the stars. Therefore, we do not recognize stars even though they are floating.

At this time, the time when there is a lot of sunlight is called day, and the time when there is no sunlight is called night, and the star is always in a constant position, but when there is a lot of sunlight during the day, it is covered by bright sunlight nearby, so a weakly shining star is not noticeable.",

Of course, the light of other stars can be bright, but the sun looks brighter because it is close to Earth.",
1098,"Since the sun is also floating while the stars are floating, relatively weaker starlight than the sun's light is not visible.",

However, even stars of the same brightness look different depending on the distance, which is called apparent grade. It is said that the smaller the apparent grade, the brighter it is. However, because the sun is much brighter than other stars, these ratings are ignored and stars are not visible only during the daytime when the sun is active.",
1100,"Because it faces the sun during the day, it is covered by strong sunlight and cannot see the light of the star.",
1101,"In order for us to see something, the object must be brighter than the surrounding background. If the light around it becomes brighter than the light emitted by the star, we cannot see the star. During the day, the light from the sun is brighter than the light that the star can make, so we cannot see the star because it is covered by the light. However, it is dark at night after sunset, so we can see the stars easily.  This is the same reason why you can find more stars in the countryside than in cities where lights don't go out at night.",
1102,"We are apt to observe stars in the night sky. However, the reason why it is difficult to observe stars during the day is that even stars with brighter brightness than the sun are difficult to recognize the brightness of stars by the light of the sun, which is relatively close to the distance.",

For example, the glow of a glow-in-the-dark sticker is only visible when the light is turned off and not visible when turned on. However, this is because the glow of the light is brighter than the glow of the light, not the glow of the light goes out. Like this, there is light during the day, so the stars are not visible because it is bright.",
