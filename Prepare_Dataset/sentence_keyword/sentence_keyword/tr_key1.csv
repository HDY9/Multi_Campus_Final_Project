789,The electricity turns off automatically when you use a lot of electricity,,,,
790,Because it's connected in parallel,,,,
791,I don't know.,,,,
792,"""When replacing an outlet, insert a screw that secures the outlet to the wall, and if you insert a longer screw than necessary, you will be able to cover the electrical wire",,,,
793,,,,,
794,"You take it off, and you put an electric wire on the ground pole, and you put it on the ground pole like an air conditioner, and you put it on the ground",,,,
795,,,,,
796,"If you insert it, it will cause a short circuit and the breaker will go down",,,,
797,"Therefore, I think it's screwing into a long, replace the outlet after can be separated from the wall outlet because he touched the wire.",,,,
798,,,,,
799,Air conditioning in an outlet to breaker is used to check down.,,,,

814,"If you connect it with a parallel connection, even if one is turned off, the other is alive.",,,,
815,There's electricity,,,,
816,How do I know?,,,,
817,It's a different current,,,,
818,The air conditioner uses too much energy,,,,
819,"It is because it is connected in series, and it can be connected in parallel. In parallel connections, even if one line is broken, electric current flows to another place, so other electronics can be used as it is.",,,,
820,It's because the cord is connected in parallel,,,,
821,"This is because it is connected to the parallel connection of the battery, so even if one line is broken, current flows in the other line.",,,,
822,This is because they connected home appliances in parallel.,,,,
823,Let's save electricity,,,,
824,Because the air conditioner is connected in series and the other electronics are connected in parallel,,,,

830,I don't know,,,,
831,I don't know!,,,,
832,Because I used electricity only for the air conditioner,,,,
833,I don't know.,,,,
834,Because it's connected in parallel,,,,
835,It's because the electric cord is flowing in parallel,,,,
836,The electronics are directly connected,,,,

839,It's a parallel connection,,,,
840,Because it is connected in parallel.,,,,
841,It's connected in parallel,,,,
842,"This is because electricity is connected in parallel, so only the current flowing in the air conditioner is abnormal.",,,,

844,Parallel connection,,,,
845,in parallel,,,,
846,be connected in parallel,,,,
847,I don't have a fuse,,,,
848,Because the current of the air conditioner is connected in parallel,,,,

850,in a better world,,,,
851,The AC has a lot of electricity,,,,
852,have a lot of electricity bills,,,,
853,It's because we didn't connect it in series but in parallel,,,,
854,Because there was still electricity flowing,,,,
855,This is because the air conditioner itself cut off electricity.,,,,
856,I don't know.,,,,
857,Because it is connected in parallel.,,,,
858,Other electronics don't have electricity,,,,
859,I don't know.,,,,
860,an excessive amount of electricity,,,,
861,It's in parallel,,,,
862,"Electronics can catch fire if they overheat, so there is a system where the machine discharges them",,,,
863,I'm going to plug in the socket,,,,
864,in parallel,,,,
865,"It's connected, so of course it's all turned on. (Electricity is connected, of course) Yeah.That's what I'",,,,
866,?,,,,
867,"Because it is turned off or turned on depending on how the electronics are connected, other properly connected electronics are not turned off and air conditioners with excessive current are turned off.",,,,
868,It's because I didn't leave out the concept.,,,,
869,I don't know,,,,
870,That's how electricity works. Ask Einstein for details. Or the original answer is number 12 saved in the computer program,,,,
871,"If it's connected, it turns on and if it's not connected, it turns off",,,,
872,Connect to other poll logs,,,,
873,This is because electronics are connected in parallel.,,,,
874,Wall heat connection,,,,
875,electrically-alternating,,,,
876,I don't know.,,,,
877,I doubt it.,,,,
878,Because it is connected in parallel.,,,,
879,This is because the code is constantly flowing.,,,,
880,Because it's connected in parallel,,,,
881,I don't know,,,,
882,"Since the electricity is connected separately,",,,,
883,It is because it is connected in parallel.,,,,

886,I don't know.,,,,
887,It's annoying.,,,,
888,Because it has octopus feet,,,,
