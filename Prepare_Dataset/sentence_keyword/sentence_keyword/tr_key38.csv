2,I don't know,,,
3,I didn't put air on it,,,
4,Because it melts,,,
5,The plastic bottle is weak,,,
6,I think it's because of the temperature change because it suddenly gets cold after being in a hot place,,,
7,It's melted,,,
8,It was hot and I bought it in the cold,,,
9,"The plastic bottle is in contact with the hot air, so the air is inside, because the hot air inside disappears when it meets the cold air.",,,
10,There's a big difference in temperature,,,
11,"Because the air temperature is different,",,,

14,"The plastic bottle is hot outside, and suddenly it seems to be crushed in the cold refrigerator",,,
15,The bottle that received the hot air suddenly received the cold air,,,
16,because of the pressure,,,
17,Because the temperature of the air is different.,,,
18,"The plastic bottle expands if it is hot, and if it is cold, the plastic bottle is crushed in reverse.",,,
19,Because the air in the plastic bottle is hot air and the air in the refrigerator is cold.,,,
20,"Because if you put it in the refrigerator, the warm bottle gets cold and contracts.",,,
21,"It was hot, but I think it happened because the temperature suddenly changed like it was getting cold",,,
22,Just,,,
23,Just,,,
24,This is because the air in the plastic bottle evaporated.,,,
25,I don't know,,,
26,"It's hot, but why doesn't my plastic get crushed?;;;;;;?",,,
27,"Because of the cold air in the refrigerator,",,,
28,It's hot outside and cool inside the refrigerator,,,
29,This is because it changed from a hot space to a cold space.,,,
30,I don't know.,,,
31,at a low air pressure,,,
32,under heavy pressure,,,
33,This is because the plastic bottle was expanded by heat and then contracted due to a sudden decrease in temperature.,,,
34,The plastic bottle froze and the water froze,,,
35,The temperature was atmospheric pressure. It's a low-pressure in-he compression pig,,,
36,"From hot air to cold air,",,,
37,I don't know,,,
38,"As the ice ran out of oxygen, oxygen seemed to meet at the bottom",,,
39,This is because the volume of air has decreased as it cools.,,,
40,"Because the temperature of the plastic bottle outside and the temperature of the refrigerator are different,",,,
41,I think it's because the hot air suddenly got cold because of the summer,,,
42,This is because the temperature difference in the air in the PET bottle is getting worse.,,,
43,This is because the temperature changes a lot.,,,
44,It's because the temperature changes a lot,,,
45,I was in the middle of the heat and came to the cold,,,

61,"In summer, the temperature outside is high, but the refrigerator is low, so it is due to sudden temperature changes.",,,
62,"Since the temperature is high, the plastic bottle seems to have melted and been crushed.",,,
63,It may be because the temperature changes.,,,

66,an elder brother,,,
67,"The warm air was surrounding the surface, but when the cold air suddenly touches the surface, it seems to have been crushed under pressure",,,
68,I didn't put it in the fridge,,,
69,"This is because when the temperature of the gas inside the bottle decreases, it contracts",,,
70,"Due to the increase in temperature, the air temperature in the expanded plastic bottle increases, contracts, and scratches.",,,
71,"The ambient temperature is low. Therefore, the temperature of the air inside the plastic is lowered, so that the air is contracted.",,,
72,"It's because the temperature has gone down. When the pressure is constant, the temperature and volume are proportional.",,,
73,"As the temperature goes down, the volume goes down",,,
74,"By Charles' law, the temperature decreases and the volume of the cylinder gas decreases.",,,
75,The thermal expansion of the gas contracts.,,,
76,by decreasing volume,,,
77,Because of the high atmospheric pressure,,,
78,"As the temperature inside the bottle decreases, the pressure inside the bottle decreases and the plastic bottle is crushed.",,,
79,"This is because the gas in the expanded plastic bottle is put in the refrigerator due to the hot temperature, and the temperature decreases rapidly, causing the gas in the plastic bottle to contract.",,,
80,"If the temperature is high, the volume of the gas expands, and if the temperature is lowered, the volume of the gas decreases, so if you put the plastic bottle outside in the refrigerator, the volume of the gas decreases, so the bottle is crushed.",,,
81,"The reason why the plastic bottle outside is crushed when put in the refrigerator in summer is that the temperature of the air in the refrigerator is lower, which is larger than the density of the air inside the plastic bottle, so the pressure is higher.",,,
82,"Gas in a plastic bottle has a volume suitable for a certain temperature, and when placed in a refrigerator, the temperature of the gas decreases and the volume of the gas decreases and is crushed.",,,
83,"The temperature of the plastic bottle decreases, reducing the volume of the gas in the bottle",,,
84,The ambient temperature has decreased,,,
85,"As the temperature of the air in the plastic bottle decreased, the volume of the air decreased, and the pressure decreased, and it was crushed by the surrounding pressure.",,,
86,"If a sealed plastic container is left at a high temperature, gas particles inside the plastic container receive heat energy, which activates molecular movement. Accordingly, the number of air particles hitting the inner wall of the plastic cylinder increases. On the other hand, gas particles in the refrigerator are deprived of heat energy from the surroundings due to low ambient temperature, and molecular motion is also slowed, reducing the number of gas particles hitting objects. When a heated plastic container is placed inside the refrigerator, the pressure inside the container is relative to the refrigerator (outside)",,,
87,"In summer, atoms inside plastic move actively because of the high temperature. At this time, if you put the plastic bottle in the refrigerator, the temperature suddenly decreases, so the atoms inside the plastic suddenly slow down. Therefore, if you put plastic bottles outside in the refrigerator in the summer, they will be crushed.",,,
88,"According to the gas abnormality equation, the temperature is proportional to the pressure when the volume is constant, so the plastic bottle in the refrigerator is crushed because the temperature decreases, the internal pressure decreases, and the internal pressure is relatively lower than the external pressure.",,,
89,"The higher the temperature, the more active the motion of the gas becomes. That is, when the temperature of the gas in the enclosed space is changed, the degree of motion is changed, and thus the volume is also changes. The plastic bottle outside heats up, increasing the volume of gas in the plastic bottle. Putting the bottle in a cold refrigerator reduces temperature, reducing gas motion, and reducing volume. Therefore, the bottle is crushed.",,,
90,"This is because the gas in the plastic bottle, which has increased in volume because it is warm, entered the refrigerator filled with cold air, and the air in the plastic bottle contracted, reducing the volume.",,,
91,Because of the temperature difference,,,
92,"Gas increases in volume when the temperature increases, and decreases in volume when the temperature decreases. If you put a plastic bottle in the refrigerator where the temperature is high, the temperature decreases, reducing the volume of the gas in the plastic bottle, which causes the plastic bottle to be crushed.",,,
93,"The air in the plastic bottle is heated, so the mass, or density, of air per same volume decreases. In this state, when the lid is closed and put into the refrigerator, the low-density air inside is cooled and the volume is reduced, so it is crushed.",,,
94,"The volume of the gas is related to the temperature, and the air in the plastic bottle has a high temperature, which increases the volume of the gas. However, because the temperature of the refrigerator is lower than outside, the volume of the gas decreases and becomes crushed.",,,
95,"In summer, if a plastic bottle that is heated outside and the internal pressure increases suddenly enters the refrigerator and the temperature decreases, the internal pressure decreases and the plastic bottle decreases.",,,
96,"In summer, the temperature is high and the air in the plastic bottle is active, so there are many collisions with the plastic bottle, but when placed in the refrigerator, the temperature decreases, and the air in the plastic bottle slows down, causing the plastic bottle to crush.",,,
97,"When plastic bottles are placed outside in summer, the air inside becomes active and the air pressure is lowered. As the temperature increases, the molecular motion of air increases, so the volume increases, and as the volume increases with air of the same mass, the internal air pressure increases. But when you put it in the refrigerator, the temperature drops rapidly. When the temperature decreases, the molecular motion slows down, so the volume decreases and the internal pressure decreases because of the same mass of air, so the external pressure is relatively high and the force to press the plastic bottle becomes strong and crushed.",,,
98,"The air in the plastic bottle decreases in molecular motion and volume as the temperature decreases. As the air volume of the plastic bottle decreases and the air pressure decreases, the air pressure of the outside air increases relatively, and the volume of the bottle decreases in order to make the air pressure equal.When you put a plastic bottle outside in the summer, the air inside becomes hot due to heat energy. The volume of air increases as the temperature increases, which also occurs in plastic bottles placed outside. It exists in a state in which the volume is relatively large and the pressure inside the bottle is increased. If you put a plastic bottle in this state in a refrigerator with a low temperature, the temperature of the air whose temperature has risen decreases, and the volume of the air whose temperature has decreased also decreases. The reduced volume of air causes a decrease in the pressure of pushing the PET bottle, which causes the external pressure to be relatively strong and causes the PET bottle to be crushed.",,,
99,"Gas tends to expand as the temperature increases, and contracts as the temperature decreases. Comparing the temperature of room temperature in summer with the temperature inside the refrigerator, the temperature of room temperature in summer is relatively higher. So, when the gas in the bottle, which was placed at room temperature, enters the refrigerator, it means that it moves from a high temperature to a low temperature. Therefore, the gas in the bottle will shrink and the bottle will be crushed because it means that the temperature will move to a place where it is low.",,,
100,a decrease in volume by temperature,,,
101,Decreased volume as high-yield temperatures in plastic bottles decrease,,,
102,This is because the volume contracts as the heated air cools.,,,

124,"Because they have a higher pressure, temperature goes down.",,,
125,Hot air in contact with cold air and when you see the movement of air molecules by the cold air gets smaller and crushed by volume is reduced accordingly.,,,
126,"A higher temperature reduces the amount of air per unit volume. Putting plastic bottles in this state in the refrigerator lowers the temperature, increasing the amount of air per unit volume, reducing the volume of plastic bottles.",,,
127,"In the summer, the temperature of the plastic bottle increased due to the high temperature, and as soon as the temperature entered the refrigerator with the low temperature, the temperature decreased rapidly, and the volume contracted, so it was crushed",,,
