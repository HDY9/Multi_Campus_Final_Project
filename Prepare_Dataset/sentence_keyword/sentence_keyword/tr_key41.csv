81,"After breathing several times, the content of carbon dioxide in the air in the bag increased, and the content of oxygen would have decreased. Because breathing repeats inhalation and exhalation, and in the process of inhalation and exhalation, the lungs absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. As this is repeated, the oxygen content in the air decreases, and the carbon dioxide content increases, and it can be said that it feels stuffy after breathing several times. Therefore, the content of carbon dioxide in the air in the bag that has been breathed several times would have increased, and the content of oxygen would have decreased.",,,
82,"There is constant oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bag, and as you breathe many times, oxygen decreases and carbon dioxide increases due to breathing",,,

90,The oxygen in the plastic bag comes out of my mouth through my breath and fills the plastic bag with carbon dioxide.,,,
91,"When you breathe first, you have the same amount of oxygen as the ratio in the atmosphere. This is about 20% oxygen, and people are used to breathing in this proportion of oxygen. Humans breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, and the reason why we don't lack oxygen is that there's so much oxygen in the atmosphere. However, within the limited space in the plastic bag, people continue to use oxygen and the amount of oxygen in the plastic bag becomes insufficient. In the end, breathe in oxygen from your inhalation. As oxygen is exhaled from exhalation, the ratio of oxygen to the air in the plastic bag decreases and the ratio of carbon dioxide increases.",,,
92,"There was oxygen in the plastic bag that stuck to the mouth. However, as we breathe in and out of the plastic bag, oxygen decreases, and while we breathe out, carbon dioxide increases in the plastic bag.",,,
93,"Due to breathing, the amount of oxygen in the bag decreases, and the amount of carbon dioxide increases.",,,
94,"After breathing several times, the change in air in the bag is to inhale fresh air oxygen, further reducing oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide by exhaling carbon dioxide.  The decrease in oxygen and the increase in carbon dioxide occurred simultaneously, increasing the ratio of carbon dioxide.",,,
95,"Oxygen comes in during inhalation and carbon dioxide goes out during exhalation. Therefore, if you breathe repeatedly in a sealed space, oxygen is gradually lost and carbon dioxide is gradually increased when you inhale, so oxygen decreases and carbon dioxide increases in the air in the bag.",,,
96,"Humans breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide as they breathe, reducing the amount of oxygen in the bag and increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the bag.",,,
97,Oxygen disappears through breathing.,,,
98,"When we breathe, we absorb oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide. Therefore, as we breathe in the bag, oxygen concentration decreases and carbon dioxide concentration increases.Before breathing several times, the bag had more oxygen than carbon dioxide, but the oxygen concentration in the bag gradually decreases and the carbon dioxide concentration gradually increases due to the carbon dioxide emission from the exhalation. In addition, water droplets will form inside the bag as the steam exhaled from the mouth meets and condenses with the bag.",,,
99,"When a person breathes in oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide. However, since it is a case of breathing after the mouth is in close contact with the entrance of the bag, the bag is in a sealed state. Therefore, the amount of oxygen in the bag will decrease, while the amount of carbon dioxide will increase.",,,

1317,"When inhaling, oxygen gas contained in the air is absorbed by cells for use in the body, and exhales to export carbon dioxide, a waste. Therefore, if you continue to inhale and exhale in a sealed bag, the proportion of oxygen in the air in the bag decreases and the proportion of carbon dioxide increases, which will absorb enough oxygen from the body.",,,
1318,The amount of oxygen decreases and the amount of carbon dioxide increases.,,,
1319,Because it's full of carbon dioxide,,,
1320,The bag is full of carbon dioxide.,,,
1321,be filled with carbon dioxide,,,
1322,Only Co2 will remain.,,,
1323,"Oxygen decreases, carbon dioxide increases.",,,
1324,"Decreased oxygen concentration, increased carbon dioxide concentration",,,
1325,ã´ and ãã,,,
1326,It's full of carbon dioxide,,,
1327,Full of carbon dioxide,,,
1328,contain carbon dioxide,,,
1329,It was converted to carbon dioxide from oxygen,,,
1330,Oxygen is gone and carbon dioxide is formed.,,,
1331,It's full of carbon dioxide.,,,
1332,I'll give it a try.,,,
1333,"At first, there was a lot of oxygen in the bag, but human breathing reduces oxygen and accumulates carbon dioxide in the bag, reducing the amount of oxygen to breathe.",,,
1334,"At first, there was a lot of oxygen in the bag, but due to human breathing, oxygen decreases and carbon dioxide accumulates in the bag, reducing oxygen to breathe.",,,
1335,The proportion of oxygen decreases and the proportion of carbon dioxide increases.,,,
1336,an increase in carbon dioxide,,,
1337,The amount of oxygen has decreased,,,
1338,It's getting soft,,,
1339,It's shrinking,,,
1340,Bigger and bigger,,,
1341,Oxygen has decreased and carbon dioxide has increased.,,,
1342,The air decreases.,,,
