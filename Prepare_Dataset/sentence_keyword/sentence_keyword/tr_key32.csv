533,"This is because errors can occur during the trial, causing innocent victims.",
534,"The most valid conclusion can be drawn through several trials to determine whether the outcome of the trial is correct or not. If there is no three-trial system, more and more people will be sentenced unfairly and criminals will be found not guilty even after committing crimes.",
535,It is to ensure that the rights of the people are not violated and that they are secured,
536,This is to reduce situations in which a single trial cannot produce a perfect ruling and the human rights of the people can be ignored.,
537,This is to prevent misjudgments caused by the presiding judge's mistakes as much as possible.,
538,To respect human rights and make it a fair trial,
539,"Since the judge is also a person, he may make a biased trial or make mistakes. Therefore, in order to ensure human rights more accurately and without errors, a three-trial system is implemented to allow up to three trials to reduce human rights that are violated by wrong judgment.",
540,"Since a single trial may lead to unfair results, it is possible to have several trials to make a judgment that is fair.",
541,"The reason for operating the three-trial system is that there is a possibility that both sides will have unacceptable results, such as misunderstandings or corruption during the trial.",
542,"Once a trial is made, the judgment cannot always be accurate. Therefore, in order to minimize unfair people through three opportunities, a three-trial system is operated that allows up to three trials.",
543,This is to minimize the violation of the human rights of the suspect due to a misjudgment.,
544,"Since there may be cases where the results of the first and second trials are wrong and can be unfairly damaged, trials are conducted up to three times to prevent this.",
545,"Most trials are conducted fairly. However, there are factors that will be disadvantageous in trials such as lack of evidence, or political meddling. Therefore, the judiciary provides an opportunity to be tried up to three times, allowing fairness to be maintained under any circumstances.",
546,"Since judges are also human, there may be judgments, mistakes, or misjudgments based on individual emotions, so they are operated a system that allows them to be tried up to three times to minimize them so that all citizens can receive a fair trial.",
547,"The reason for having three rulings: the first judgment of the district court, the second judgment of the high court, and the third judgment of the Supreme Court is necessary for the people to make a proper judgment that is not unfair. If a judgment is found guilty or not, three chances are given to prevent damage to the defendant in advance if the judgment is wrong.",
548,"Humans cannot always be objective because they have their own subjective thoughts and feelings. Judges can sometimes make judgments biased against their emotions, which can damage the person on trial. Judges can be tried up to three times to minimize the possibility of making errors and guarantee the human rights of those on trial.",

550,"Since judges are also human, they can make mistakes in the trial process, and they want to guarantee the basic rights of the people by eliminating situations in which those who participate in the trial cannot accept the outcome of the trial or feel unfair about the outcome.",
551,"The three-trial system is one that guarantees a fair trial. It is a system that allows people to face up to three trials for those who cannot recognize the results in a single trial, and it stems from the reason that there are no people who suffer unfairness and damage as a result of the trial.",
552,"This is for the rights of the victims. There can be people who are unfairly damaged by the wrong judgment of the court, and through three trials, such a system is operated to minimize such injustice and protect people's human rights.",
553,"This is because the person who applied for or received the trial may feel unfair. If all results are determined in a single trial, the person who has requested or received the trial there may be very disadvantageous to the person who has not yet said or said anything.",

630,It gives a chance for a fair and just trial.,
631,The reason for operating the three-trial system is that judging a person's guilt through a single trial can be a mistake or misunderstanding by a judge.,

645,Trials are made three times for accurate and just judgment.,
