870,Because the hot air is light (that is why the heater is installed on the floor),,,,,,,
871,"When heat is applied to the air, it expands. And the air moves from warm to cold, and the surface is relatively warmer than the sky, so it can go up. After passing just a certain point, the sky gets hotter than the ground.",,,,,,,
872,"As the temperature rises, the motion of the gas becomes more active, making the gap between the particles distant and with the hot air balloon.The number of collisions increases. Also, hot air can float because it tries to go up.",,,,,,,
873,"When heated, the thermal movement of air becomes more active, and with the same logic as the previous question, the density decreases and the volume increases. It now has the power to rise up and can go up into the sky.",,,,,,,

878,I don't know,,,,,,,
879,"Hot air has a wider gap between particles than cold air and is active in motion. Therefore, when the air is heated, the hot air tries to rise upward compared to the cold air, so the hot air balloon floats.",,,,,,,
880,"As the temperature increases, the motion of the gas increases, and the density decreases relatively, so it rises up. Because of this, heating the air in the hot air balloon can cause the air to rise to the sky by the force to rise.",,,,,,,
