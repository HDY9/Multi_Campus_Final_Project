1029,This is because the earth orbits the sun once a year.,
1030,"Stars are always there without moving on the celestial sphere, but the Earth orbits, so the position of the celestial sphere changes, so the constellation seen varies depending on the season.",
1031,"Through the performance movement of the sun, the sun changes its position as the moon progresses through the ecliptic. On the other hand, constellations appear to be embedded in places because they are so far from the Earth. Then, the sun moves but the constellations are fixed, so the constellations change their positions, while the constellations rise and set in the same position every time, but the sun changes, so constellations that used to rise like the sun in summer can rise after the sun sets in winter. In this case, constellations that were not seen in summer are visible in winter, so constellations vary depending on the season.",
1032,Constellations appear to be different because the Earth is a planet orbiting the sun and the stars are fixed points on the celestial sphere that do not move.,
1033,This is because constellations divide commuting.,
1034,"Because the earth rotates and revolves,",

1048,Since the earth is moving,
1049,Because the earth revolves,
1050,"Because the earth revolves around it, it is different from the constellation",
1051,This is because the earth revolves.,
1052,"The Earth rotates slightly tilted around the sun, which makes the position and brightness of the star appear to vary over time.",

1072,Because the earth revolves.,
1073,"As the Earth orbits, the stars stay still, but the Earth moves and the constellations that can be seen from the Earth change.",
1074,"The earth orbits the sun every year. Therefore, the direction of the Earth's view at night varies from season to season. That's why my zodiac sign changes",
1075,This is because constellations are also covered by the sun's light like stars depending on the sun's performance movement.,
1076,This is because the earth revolves around the sun.,
1077,"It is because of the revolution of the earth.We see stars at night because the intense sunlight is reflected in the Earth's atmosphere, so that we can't see stars floating in the sky during the day. However, in the daytime sky, there is the opposite constellation of seasonal constellations. For example, now winter constellations are starting to appear one by one.In the middle of the day, there are summer constellations in the sky, not winter constellations. But in addition to its rotation, the Earth revolves around the sun. Then the position changes little by little as it orbits. Then the constellations seen on winter nights rise in the middle of the day in summer. That's because, compared to when the Earth is in winter, in summer, it goes halfway around and on the other side. (I researched ^_^)",
1078,"Stars don't move. However, the constellations seen vary from season to season because the Earth rotates in place and orbits around the sun.",
1079,"Because the Earth orbits, constellations continue to vary from season to season at one point on Earth.",
1080,"The reason why constellations change depending on the season is that the earth revolves around the sun. As the Earth orbits around the sun, the position of the Earth's constellation changes slightly from day to day, and the constellation seen from the Earth changes depending on the season.",
1081,"A constellation is a group of stars. This star is always there. Unlike stars, however, the Earth rotates and revolves. In the end, it can be seen that constellations change depending on the season because the earth revolves. Of course, there are constellations that are always observed even when the seasons change. (EX. Big Dipper, North Star, Cassiopeia)",
1082,"The Earth moves with time, or seasons. In other words, this movement is called the revolution. In addition, constellations are distributed in various ways depending on the location. So the Earth moves and the constellations we can see change.",
1083,"The type and location of constellations that appear to be different are different because the earth revolves, not the stars.",
1084,"The earth orbits once a month. As a result, if the Earth's position changes, the constellations seen from the Earth change.",
1085,"Because the Earth orbits once a year, the night sky we can see varies depending on the season. Due to this, the constellations seen vary from season to season.",
1086,"The Earth revolves around the sun, and the constellations on the back of the Earth change.",
1087,"As the Earth orbits once a year, the location of the Earth changes, so the places that can be seen from the Earth change. Therefore, the constellations that appear in different seasons are different.",
1088,"This is because the earth revolves.Stars are always floating in place. However, constellations look different from season to season because the Earth revolves around the sun and the Earth itself revolves due to the phenomenon of orbit. If the stars had turned like Earth, just as we could only see the back of the moon, no matter how much the seasons changed, only one constellation could be played.",
1089,"This is because the earth revolves around the sun. Because the sun and celestial bodies are stationary in place while the Earth revolves around the sun, the sun seems to be playing on Earth. And since the constellation on the side where the sun is located is not visible because it is covered by the sun, the constellation that the sun sees seems to change as it performs.",
1090,"As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the position of the Earth's constellations changes little by little from day to day and the constellations change according to the season.  Stars in space are so far apart that they seem to be fixed. At this time, invisible stars also appear because if the star is located on the sun's side, the sun's light is too bright to observe the star.",
1091,"The earth revolves around the sun, and this revolution of the earth causes seasonal changes. Because of the constellations in the universe, we can infer these Earth movements. When the earth revolves around the sun, the constellation on the side that receives sunlight does not look bright, but the constellation on the other side of the sun can be observed at night. At this time, as it orbits, the appearance of constellations changes from season to season. In other words, the difference in constellations that can be observed as the Earth orbits around the sun causes differences in constellation observation according to the season.",
1092,"Just as the shape of the moon changes every day, the constellation changes because the earth revolves around, there are places covered by the sun, and there are places where the sun shines.",
1093,"This is because as the Earth orbits, what constellations are located in the night sky changes.",
