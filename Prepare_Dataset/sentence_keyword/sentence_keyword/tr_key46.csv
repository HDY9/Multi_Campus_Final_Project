79,"The land, which has a high specific heat, heats up faster than the sea during the day, and the air from the land rises before the air from the sea, and the wind blows from the sea to the land. High sea air rises and winds blow from land to sea.",,
80,"Seawater with high specific heat heats up slowly and cools down slowly, so the temperature is relatively lower than that of sandy beaches during the day. So the air goes down, and the sandy beach temperature rises because it's hot. Because of these currents, the wind blows from the sea to the land during the day. At night, because seawater with a high specific heat cools slowly, the air rises because the temperature is relatively higher than that of a sandy beach. So at night, the wind blows from the sandy beach to the beach.",,
81,The reason is that the higher temperature changes during the day and at night due to the specific train difference between the sea and the land.,,
82,"During the day, when the sea receives solar heat, the temperature rises slowly because the specific heat is large. However, the land temperature rises relatively quickly because the specific heat is small. Therefore, the wind blows from the sea to the land during the day because the sea is relatively colder than the land, but at night, the wind cools down quickly and the wind direction changes in the opposite direction.",,
83,"During the day, the sunlight makes the sand hotter than the water, and the air over the sand rises and the air over the water moves there.",,
84,"During the day, the temperature of the sandy beach is higher than that of the sea, so the air on the sandy beach rises and the air from the sea flows into the empty spot, so the wind blows from the sea to the land. The wind blows from the land to the sea because the air above the sandy beach flows into the empty spot.",,
85,"During the day, the sand heats up faster than the sea, which maintains a nearly constant temperature, so hot air is created on land and cold air is created in the sea, which causes convection and wind blows toward the land. Because it is cooler than the sea, relatively hot air is produced in the sea, and cold air is produced on the land, and the wind blows toward the sea.",,
86,"During the day, the sandy beach heats up rapidly, and the land wind blows from the land to the sea because the pressure on the land side is higher than the pressure on the sea side. As a result, the pressure on the sea side is higher and the air pressure on the land side is lower, and the sea wind blows from the sea to the land.",,
87,"The sea has a low specific heat, and the land has a high specific heat. Therefore, during the day, the land heats up faster than the sea, and the temperature is higher than the sea, so wind blows from the sea to the land.",,
88,"The land has a higher specific heat than the sea, so the temperature changes more easily. During the day, the temperature rises more easily on land than in the sea due to solar radiation, and the air pressure on land is lowered, and wind blows from the sea. the wind will blow towards",,
89,"As described in 1), the land temperature is relatively high during the day, and the sea temperature is relatively high at night. Therefore, the land becomes a low pressure during the day and the sea becomes a low pressure at night, and the wind blows towards the land during the day and towards the sea at night.",,
90,"When the temperature of the sandy beach/sea is high, the wind blows to the low-temperature ocean/sand beach.",,
91,because of the difference in specific heat,,
92,"Sand and sea temperature rise and fall at different rates even when they receive the same amount of sunlight. Because of this, the air from the relatively warm side rises and the air from the relatively low temperature side moves to fill its place, creating wind at the seashore. goes During a sunny day, the sand temperature is higher than that of the sea, so wind blows from the sea to the land. blow",,
93,"During the day, the land side has a higher temperature, so the air on the land side rises and the wind blows from the sea, but at night the sea side maintains a higher temperature, which causes the wind to blow from the land.",,
94,"During the day, the temperature of the sea air is lower than that of the land air, so when the land air rises and the pressure decreases, the sea air moves to fill the empty space. The reason is that the air from the sea moves to the land and the wind blows. Conversely, at night, the air temperature in the sea rises because it is relatively warmer than the air temperature over land. As a result, the atmospheric pressure of the sea is lowered, and air moves to fill this empty space from the land, so the wind blows over the land to the sea. This shows that the specific train difference is due to changing the direction of the wind.",,
95,"The beach is bordered by land and sea. The sea has a high specific heat and the land has a low specific heat. In other words, when the same heat is applied, the temperature change on land is greater than that of the sea. Therefore, during the day, the land is warmer than the sea and the air pressure is lower, and the sea is relatively colder than the land, so the air pressure rises. Here, the wind moves from the high-pressure ocean to the low-pressure land because it moves with a pressure difference. At night, the land is cooler than the sea and the air pressure rises, and the sea is relatively warmer than the land, so the air pressure is lowered. Here, the wind blows from the land to the sea because the land is high pressure and the sea is low pressure.",,
96,"Sand has a lower specific heat compared to water, so the range of temperature change is large. Therefore, the sandy beach has a wider range of temperature changes between night and day. So, during the day, the sandy beach is warmer than the sea water, and the warm air rises. The temperature of seawater is lower than that of the sandy beach, so the cooler air compared to the sandy beach air descends downwards. Cold air from the descending seawater moves toward the sandy beach, and warm air from the rising sandy beach moves toward the seawater, creating convection of air. So during the day, the wind blows from the sea to the sandy beach. At night, the sandy beach is cooler than the seawater, and the cooler air is lowered. The seawater is warmer than the sandy beach, so the warmer air rises above the sandy beach. Cold air from the descending sandy beach moves toward the seawater, and warm air from the rising seawater moves toward the sandy beach, creating convection of air. So at night, the wind blows from the sandy beach towards the sea.",,
97,"The beach consists of land and sea. During the day, the air temperature rises faster on land with a low specific heat than the sea with a high specific heat, and the air pressure rises and the air pressure decreases. Air moves from the sea to the land where the air has risen a lot. At night, the sea with a high specific heat cools slowly, and the land with a low specific heat cools quickly, causing the air to drop and the air pressure to rise. . At night, air moves from land to sea and winds blow from land to sea.",,
98,"This is because the specific heat of seawater and sandy beaches are different. Specific heat is the heat required to raise 1 kg of an object by 1 degree Celsius. Since the specific heat of sand is less than that of seawater, it heats up quickly and cools down quickly. Therefore, the sandy beach has a higher temperature than the sea during the day, and the air on the sandy beach side is heated up. As the temperature of the sea-side air rises, the sandy beach becomes high pressure and the sea becomes low pressure, and the wind blows from the sandy beach to the sea.During the day, the specific heat of the sand is smaller and the temperature changes better, so the land area becomes hotter and the air in the land area rises. As a result, the air pressure on the land side decreases, and the air pressure on the sea side increases relatively, and wind blows from the sea to the land. On the contrary, at night, the temperature of the sea is higher, so the air rises and winds blow from land to sea.",,
99,"As answered in No. 1, the gas rises and falls due to changes in temperature. However, due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature of sand during the day will be relatively higher than that of water, and at night, the temperature of water will be relatively lower than that of sand. Therefore, the position of where the gas rises and falls is reversed, and the direction of the wind will also blow differently.",,

Specific heat refers to the energy required to raise the temperature of an object, which is relatively larger than soil, so water requires more energy than soil to raise the same temperature. When sunlight falls during the day, the land with relatively small heat heats up quickly, raising the air on the land, and the air on the sea descends and blows toward the land, but at night, the air on the sea rises and winds toward the sea.",,

However, at night, the temperature on land with low specific heat decreases rapidly, and the temperature on the sea with high specific heat decreases slowly, so the temperature is relatively higher than on land. One of the reasons why the wind blows is that there is a difference in the direction of the wind because the temperature is higher during the day and at night.""",,
743,"During sunny days, the temperature on land is higher than in the sea. At this time, the air on the land side is also heated and the air rises upward. Then a low pressure is formed on the land side. Then, the relatively high-pressure sea air moves toward the low-pressure land. So during the day, the wind blows from the sea to the land, and at night, the specific heat of the water is larger than that of the land, so the temperature of the sea slowly drops and a low pressure is formed on the sea side. Therefore, high pressure is formed on the land side, so wind blows from the land to the sea.",,

1266,Because the temperature is different?,,
1267,I don't know.,,
1268,a difference in temperature,,
1269,a specific heat,,
1270,It's because of the temperature difference,,
1271,"The sea made of water and the land made of sand have different specific heat of water and sand, so water cools slowly and sand cools quickly, resulting in a temperature difference. In other words, the temperature varies depending on the night and day when the sun shines.",,
1272,"During the day, the temperature of the land is higher and the temperature of the sea is higher at night",,
1273,"Idiot, the specific heat of the water is 1 and the specific heat of the sand is smaller than the water, so the temperature of the sand changes faster, so the land temperature is higher during the day, and the sea is higher at night",,
1274,"During the day, the temperature of the land is high, so wind blows from the sea to the land, and at night, the temperature of the sea is high, so wind blows from the land to the sea.",,
1275,The temperature is different.Due to.,,
1276,"At night, the direction of the wind changes because the sunlight disappears and the sea is warmer than the land.",,
1277,This is because the temperature difference between day and night on land is large.,,
1278,"It is because the sun rises during the day and gets hot, but at night, the sun sets and gets cold.",,
1279,"During the day, the wind blows because the cold air of the sea rises and blows towards the land",,
1280,This is because the temperature changes.,,
1281,Non-thermal water > Specific heat of land,,
1282,Because the sea and the land grow in opposite directions,,
1283,The sea,,
1284,It's a temperature difference.,,
1285,"""Hot air goes up and cold air goes down. The wind is blowing because the air moves.",,
1286,"The opposite direction of the wind at day and night on the beach is because the temperature of the air above the land and the sea is different. During the day, the land heats up faster than the sea. The hot air on the land rises and fills the empty space created by the air moving from the sea side. As the air moves like this, the sea breeze blows from the sea to the land.On the contrary, at night, the land cools faster than the sea and cools faster. When the air above the sea, which is hotter than the land, rises, the empty space is filled by air moving from the land. So at night, the wind blows from land to sea.",,
1287,"The temperature in the desert is very high during the day, so even if it boils, it gets cold enough to drop below zero at night. That's how easily the ground heats up and cools down. This is because the heat of the ground is small.""",,
1288,It is because the temperature is different.,,

1296,The wind blowing from land to sea is called land wind.,,
1297,"During the day, the land, which gets hot and cools quickly, is heated first. Then the air on the heated ground is brought up by convection, and the air from the sea comes and fills the void. This is when the wind blows from the sea to the land.""",,
1298,I don't know,,
1299,Because the water in the sea is drained,,
1300,This is because there is a change in temperature.,,

1308,The direction of the night breeze is different,,
1309,I don't know,,
1310,- It's low pressure. - It's high pressure,,
1311,"Because the wind blows in the lower part of the temperature,",,
1312,"At night, the sun doesn't shine when the earth turns because it's hot",,
1313,"At night, wind moves from low sea to land from land to sea.",,
1314,I have no idea.,,
1315,There's a temperature difference between day and night,,
1316,This is because the land is hotter than the sea during the day.,,
1317,"Air comes from the cold side to the hot side, and sand is greatly influenced by sunlight during the day, so the cold sea air comes to the hot sand and is opposite at night.",,
1318,I don't know,,

1320,The temperature of the air is different during the day and night,,
1321,The temperature of the sea and land is different day and night,,
1322,This is because air moves to places where the temperature is high,,
1323,"The sand is hot during the day, but it's cold at night",,
1324,Because of the direction,,
1325,"It's because the waves are from east to west during the day, but from west to east at night.",,
1326,It's sunny during the day and not at night,,
1327,The wind direction is different because of the different temperatures.,,
1328,It is because there is no sun at night,,
1329,There's no sunlight during the day and no sunlight at night,,
1330,X,,
1331,day and night have changed,,
1332,a specific heat,,
1333,a difference in temperature difference,,
1334,Predict the direction of the wind.Because it's hard,,
1335,"This is because the temperature of the sea does not change much, but the land heats up quickly and cools down quickly, and the daily temperature range is large, so the higher temperature changes",,
1336,It's because of the difference in meanness,,
1337,"At night, the sea with a high specific heat has a higher temperature than the land",,
1338,"During the day, the temperature of the land is higher and the temperature of the sea is higher than that of the land",,
1339,"This is because the water has a large specific heat, so there is no difference in temperature",,
1340,It's cool at night hahaha,,
1341,"Because the water has a large specific heat, the air pressure is different between day and night",,
1342,Because of the difference in air pressure,,
1343,This is because sand with a small specific heat has a high temperature difference between day and night.,,
1344,Sand with a small specific heat has a high temperature difference between day and night,,
1345,"During the day, the land temperature is relatively higher and at night the sea temperature is relatively higher, so wind blows from land to sea during the day and from sea to land at night",,
1346,The directions change because the specific heat of the sea and the land is different,,
1347,Answer number two,,
1348,Because the specific heat of the sea is greater than the specific heat of the land,,
1349,The direction of the wind changes because the sea is colder than the land at night and the land is colder than the sea during the day.,,
1350,"The specific heat of sand is smaller than seawater, so it heats up faster during the day, and cools faster at night, so the direction of the wind depends on the pressure difference caused by it.",,
1351,The degree to which it is heated and cooled,,
1352,"There is a difference in specific heat between the sea and the land, which causes a temperature difference between day and night, so the direction changes between day and night.",,
1353,Because the temperature difference between the sea and the land is different day and night,,
1354,I don't understand.,,
1355,Temperature difference,,
1356,"During the day, the sand heats up faster, and at night, the sand cools faster, so there are sea and land winds",,
1357,Because the heat of the earth and the sea are different,,
1358,"Because the land heats up faster and lowers faster than water, the wind blows due to the temperature difference",,
1359,The temperature of the air in the land and the sea is reversed during the day and night,,
1360,Because of the ebb and flow,,
1361,"During the day, the air on the beach goes up, and at night, the air on the sea goes up",,
1362,The temperature is different between day and night,,
1363,This is because the land is relatively hot during the day and the sea is relatively hot at night.,,
1364,I guess we're not on good terms,,
1365,"Due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature of sand is higher than that of water during the day, but the direction of the wind is different because water with a large specific heat is higher than that of sand at night.",,
1366,"Due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature of sand is higher than that of water during the day, but water with a large specific heat at night has a higher temperature than sand, so the direction of the wind changes.",,
1367,"This is because rising air currents occur on the sand during the day due to relatively hot sand and cold seawater, and rising air currents occur on the sea due to relatively cold sand and hot seawater at night.",,
1368,"The temperature difference between day and night is small in the sea, but the temperature difference on land is large, so the temperature difference between day and night is different",,
1369,This is because the land is lower in temperature than the sea.,,
1370,The direction is always different,,
1371,Because of the temperature difference,,
1372,land and sea winds,,
1373,This is because the land is higher than the sea during the day and the sea is higher than the land at night.,,
1374,This is because sea winds blow during the day and land winds blow at night.,,
