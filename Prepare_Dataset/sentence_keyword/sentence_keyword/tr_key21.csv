735,Breathing gets faster,,,,,,,,,
736,"Once you exercise, your heart beats and you have to supply that much oxygen, so your body generates heat and releases sweat to heat it up",,,,,,,,,
737,The lack of oxygen makes my heart beat fast and I gasp,,,,,,,,,
738,"The biggest phenomenon is the beating of the heart, and the supplying of oxygen by supplying blood quickly. And because we used a lot of ATP energy while exercising, we need additional oxygen to make ATP. That's why the lungs breathe quickly. In addition, the brain promotes the production of many hormones, making people comfortable.",,,,,,,,,
739,"Your heart beats faster, oxygen moves into your muscles.",,,,,,,,,

782,We're running 100 meters and we're out of oxygen in our blood,,,,,,,,,
783,Heart rate increases after exercise and inhales oxygen while breathing hard to lower it to a normal level,,,,,,,,,
784,I'm out of breath and my heart is beating. This change causes sweat and blood circulation.,,,,,,,,,
785,"People breathe while running. The breathing should only be exhaled through the nose, but it's harder because it releases carbon dioxide through the mouth. And the pulse is beating fast. Because when you use up a lot of energy, you get cold sweat, and the organs in your body are working smoothly.",,,,,,,,,
786,"Because lactic acid forms between our muscles, our muscles get tired.",,,,,,,,,

805,"When the body needs more oxygen, breathing and heart rate are accelerated, and body temperature is increased, so the body can supply enough oxygen required by the body to perform exercise smoothly.",,,,,,,,,
806,"My heart is beating fast, I'm out of breath, because the number of gas exchanges has to increase",,,,,,,,,
807,"After exercising, our body's heart rate increases, our body temperature rises, and sweat comes out to get back to normal, so we lower our body temperature",,,,,,,,,
808,Rapid exercise leads to a lack of oxygen in the body and shortness of breath to fill the oxygen.,,,,,,,,,

820,I'm sweating and my heart is pounding,,,,,,,,,
821,Sweat and heart rate spikes,,,,,,,,,
822,Hardness,,,,,,,,,
823,"My heart is beating faster, and my body is sweating. The reason is that our bodies speed up the heart rate, facilitating the supply of blood, and discharging sweat to release waste from the body.",,,,,,,,,
824,"My body needs a lot of oxygen and water to make my heart beat fast, so I can breathe fast and get thirsty",,,,,,,,,
825,My heart is beating faster It helps blood circulation,,,,,,,,,
826,It's hard,,,,,,,,,
827,The gap between inhalation and exhalation narrows,,,,,,,,,
828,It uses up oxygen and energy by exercising in the body.,,,,,,,,,
829,"As the cells of the human body consume energy during rapid exercise, oxygen is needed to replenish energy. So your heart beats faster and your breathing becomes rough.",,,,,,,,,

842,Sweat is released and the weight is lost as sweat is released.,,,,,,,,,
843,My breath is getting better,,,,,,,,,
844,"If you exercise, you burn the fat to get rid of it.",,,,,,,,,
845,"If you suddenly exercise hard, your physical strength is basic and your lung capacity increases. Therefore, your body can develop rapidly or your muscles can grow rapidly",,,,,,,,,
846,"Because people generate heat when they exercise, they cool down by sweating to release heat from the body.",,,,,,,,,
847,"The heartbeat accelerates as the heart beats. And I sweat in my body, and sweat controls my body temperature.",,,,,,,,,
848,My heart beats fast and gasps because I sweat to cool down after exercise and need more oxygen,,,,,,,,,
849,Pumping is more active in the heart to create energy.,,,,,,,,,
850,"After rapid exercise, the cell needs more oxygen, so it needs more and more oxygen, so it is panting.",,,,,,,,,
851,"As oxygen demand increases, sympathetic nerves become excited. This causes the heart to beat fast, sweat, and body temperature to rise. And there is also muscle pain due to fine damage to the muscles.",,,,,,,,,
852,"After rapid exercise, the heart rate increases and breathing increases. It serves to supply the body with insufficient oxygen and energy.",,,,,,,,,
853,"After rapid exercise, the heart rate increases and breathing increases. It serves to supply the body with insufficient oxygen and energy.",,,,,,,,,
854,"As you sweat, your body temperature decreases. The heart beats fast and delivers blood quickly, supplying a lot of oxygen to the muscles. Breathe fast and take in a lot of oxygen.",,,,,,,,,
855,"I get shortness of breath and muscle pain. Because of the lack of oxygen, lactose accumulates in the muscles and feels tired because of the lack of oxygen. It is sweat that moisture, inorganic salts, and waste are released together.",,,,,,,,,
856,The heart beats fast and the breathing gets faster. It absorbs oxygen faster and releases carbon dioxide faster.,,,,,,,,,
857,The heart is beating faster. Because I need to supply oxygen to my body quickly.,,,,,,,,,
858,"Rapid exercise increases the heart rate, which is to supply glucose to the blood.",,,,,,,,,
859,Glycogen is broken down into glucose in the liver to obtain energy,,,,,,,,,
860,"After exercise, blood sugar decreases and glucagon breaks down glycogen into glucose.",,,,,,,,,
861,"Immediately after exercising, our bodies needed a lot of oxygen in our muscles, so our heart beats faster and our breathing volume increased.",,,,,,,,,
862,I don't know,,,,,,,,,
863,"After rapid exercise, a lot of cellular respiration occurs in the body, and oxygen is scarce, so the body's sugar drops, causing glucagon to break down glucose synthesized with glycogen in the liver. Also, if you exercise harder than usual, lactic acid can be secreted and cause muscle pain.",,,,,,,,,
864,I sweat and my heart beats fast to control my body's temperature and blood supply,,,,,,,,,
865,I don't know,,,,,,,,,
866,My heart is racing. I'm sweating,,,,,,,,,
867,"Rapid exercise boosts your metabolism. The heart beats fast and supplies blood to various organs. It is to supply oxygen. I'm also sweating, but it's to lower my body temperature because blood is supplied quickly. And breathing becomes rough. It is to fill up the lack of oxygen.",,,,,,,,,
868,"When breathing is applied and the pulse increases, the blood vessels expand. This allows blood to circulate all over the body.",,,,,,,,,
869,"The organ requires a large amount of energy, which requires oxygen, which leads to an increase in heart rate and an increase in breathing frequency. And sweat to cool off the heat generated by consuming a lot of energy. It increases the surface area of the skin to release heat better.",,,,,,,,,
870,"When you do rapid exercise, you consume the atp stored in your body and then use glycogen. After that, glucose is decomposed to generate energy, and when rapid exercise occurs, glucose is not completely decomposed and ferments, producing lactic acid, and is stored in the muscles. This can cause muscle pain.",,,,,,,,,
871,I get tired because I have lactic acid in my muscles.,,,,,,,,,
872,"My heart is beating fast. In order to supply blood quickly, the pump speed of the heart increases.",,,,,,,,,
873,"""I lose my breath and my muscles get bigger.""",,,,,,,,,
874,"It takes in more oxygen, releases carbon dioxide, and muscles bulk up with blood.""",,,,,,,,,
875,"My body temperature rises and I sweat. This requires a lot of oxygen, which makes you gasp.",,,,,,,,,
876,"Oxygen is produced, and unlike the oxygen we usually make, oxygen is produced through an oxygen production process that is shortened so that it can be made in a hurry without going through the whole process.",,,,,,,,,
877,"After exercising, you may feel short of breath, sweat, thirsty, and complain of muscle pain. When you exercise, your body's oxygen demand increases more than usual, so you lose breath, and you sweat to lower your body temperature, which has risen due to exercise. Muscle pain is caused by rapid exercise, which causes muscle cells to breathe anaerobic and accumulates lactic acid, the product of anaerobic respiration. Overall, changes occur to maintain homeostasis in the body.",,,,,,,,,
878,A high level of adrenaline causes the body to become excited,,,,,,,,,
