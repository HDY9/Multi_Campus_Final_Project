,"14. A thermos is a bottle designed to keep the temperature of water constant. If you put warm water in a thermos, you can drink warm water even in cold weather. Why do thermos bottles keep water warm even in cold winter? Let's explain in detail using our knowledge of the characteristics of heat. ",q14_heat blocking,q14_convection,q14_structure,q14_material

8,Heat is not transferred by vacuum,,,,
9,There is no heat transfer in a vacuum,,,,
10,It creates a vacuum and keeps the temperature from moving heat.,,,,
11,Because of the vacuum,,,,
12,"Heat transfer methods include conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermos make the space between the small inner bottle and the large outer bottle close to a vacuum, leaving little conduction and convection required by the material to be delivered. Radiation also usually does not occur in objects with heat, so the role of the thermos can be completed through a vacuum.",,,,
13,This is because the principle of vacuum and the characteristics of insulation were used.,,,,
14,Vacuum Heat Shutdown,,,,
15,I made it into a double wall,,,,
16,I don't know,,,,
17,Because I've been keeping my temperature.,,,,
18,There is a substance in the thermos that keeps the water warm for a long time,,,,
19,The reason why the heat cools down is because the cold air meets hot water Thermos block the outside when cold air meets hot water,,,,
20,This is because the inside of the thermos bottle has the property to keep it warm.,,,,
21,This is because the walls of the thermos are thick.,,,,
22,"Because it is literally a thermos, you can warm the water even in the cold winter.",,,,
23,"The inside of the thermos is made of iron, which can maintain the temperature.",,,,
24,The heat keeps hitting the wall of the thermos so that it doesn't escape.,,,,
25,This is because the thermos blocks the outside air.(Vacuum condition),,,,
26,It keeps the area around the thermos in a vacuum to prevent heat from entering from the outside or leaving the inside.,,,,
27,Prevent heat loss,,,,
28,"Because of the nature of the thermos,",,,,
29,There is a vacuum layer in the thermos. It is kept warm because heat is not transferred.,,,,
30,This is because heat insulation prevents heat from being released to the outside,,,,

38,Heat cannot escape the thermos because there is a space to block heat,,,,
39,This is because the thermos was reproduced with insulation to reduce heat loss.,,,,
40,This is because insulation is used when making thermos.,,,,
41,"Heat is transferred by convective conduction radiation, which creates a vacuum layer in the middle to block heat transfer by convection and conduction. In the end, heat is transferred only by infrared radiation to maintain the temperature.",,,,
42,"Thermos are mostly equipped with two methods of insulation. The inside is coated in silver, and the inside and outside are blocked by vacuum to prevent heat energy from entering due to convection and completion.",,,,
43,Thermos used insulation in and out of heat as an energy called heat.,,,,
44,Insulation that keeps heat from going out of the thermos,,,,
45,It's because the thermos acts as an insulator,,,,
46,This is because it acts as an insulating agent for thermos.,,,,
47,"In solids, heat is transferred through a method called conduction, and the thermos uses a vacuum layer to block this conduction, so it keeps the water warm.",,,,
48,This is because it does the dynamics of insulation in a thermos bottle.,,,,
49,"This is because a device was used to prevent heat from conducting, radiating, or convection.",,,,
50,"Since the thermos is made for insulation, the water inside is kept warm because it blocks conduction, convection, and radiation to prevent internal heat from going out.",,,,
51,Thermos keep the heat from escaping,,,,
52,The thermos bottle can be kept warm because heat conduction through a medium is difficult because there is a vacuum space inside.,,,,

408,"This is because insulation is placed between the thermos and the outside to insulate it, keeping it warm from the temperature outside.",,,,
409,"The thermos is double-structured so that heat cannot be counted. That is, after blocking heat from the first heat insulating wall, heat is almost completely prevented from being collected from the second heat insulating wall, thereby maintaining a temperature of warm water.",,,,
410,"Thanks to the double wall of the thermos, the heat doesn't leak or come in.",,,,
411,"Heat cannot be conducted without a medium, but since it is in a vacuum between the internal material and the external material of the thermos bottle, heat is not conducted, resulting in less heat loss",,,,
412,This is because the heat transfer is difficult due to the vacuum between the walls,,,,
413,It prevents heat loss because there is a vacuum space between the outside and the inside of the thermos.,,,,

418,Thermos usually have more than one wall or use a material with many holes such as styrofoam to place a lot of space between the inside and the outside. So you can keep the water warm even in the cold winter.,,,,
419,"In order to change the temperature of the water in the bottle, there are radiation (heat) generated by sunlight, hot water circulates in the bottle, convection where the temperature rises, and the temperature drops due to vacuum between the outer wall and the inner wall.",,,,
420,"Heat transfer methods include conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermos are mainly intended to block double conduction. Conductivity is minimized through plating and vacuum layers to prevent heat movement and maintain the existing temperature.",,,,
421,This is because the thermos contains substances that heat-treat.,,,,
422,"Heat is gradually released to the outside over time, and eventually, it is in thermal equilibrium with the outside temperature. However, in the case of a thermos bottle, the temperature of the water can be maintained because the heat flowing out to the outside remains inside without flowing out.",,,,
423,"Thermal energy travels largely in three ways: conduction, convection, and radiation. In the case of thermos, a vacuum space is created between the bottle and the outer space to block the movement of heat energy, thereby maintaining the temperature of the material in the thermos.",,,,
424,Thermos use the principle of insulation. Insulation means blocking the movement of heat. The way a thermos makes an insulation effect is to add another container on the outside of the container for water and vacuum between the two containers.,,,,
425,"The thermos is made of two layers, and there is an air layer that has an insulating effect between the two layers of walls. Heat moves from high to low and has the property of becoming the same temperature as the surroundings, and the air layer between the two layers of walls blocks it so that the thermos can work.",,,,
426,"The way heat is transferred in everyday life is convection and conduction, but the heat transfer does not occur well because the thermos is vacuumed inside",,,,
427,"Heat inside the thermos will be conducted through glass walls or caps, but it takes a lot of time to change the temperature because glass, plastic, and cork that make up the walls or caps are all nonconductors.  So thermos has less heat loss due to conduction.  In addition, since the thermos has a vacuum wall, heat loss due to convection in which air moves through the wall is small.  The silver plated wall inside the bottle reflects heat back into the bottle. Accordingly, heat loss due to radiation is also prevented.",,,,
428,"Thermos have substances or empty spaces in the bottle that prevent heat from moving, which prevents heat from moving.",,,,
429,"There is an almost vacuum in the thermos. This part has little substance, so it is not easy to transfer heat. Therefore, heat exchange between the material outside and the material inside does not occur well, allowing the water to be maintained at its original temperature.",,,,
