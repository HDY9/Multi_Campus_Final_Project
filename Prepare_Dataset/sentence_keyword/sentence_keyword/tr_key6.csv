681,It is to make a profit by exporting products that are advantageous for their country to produce.,,,,,,
682,Each country has a product with high production efficiency and a low product. This is because exchanging each through exchange increases the production efficiency of all countries that exchange eventually.,,,,,,
683,"Since the natural environment is different from country to country, resources and agricultural products produced in each country are different, so we exchange necessary goods through exchanges between different countries.",,,,,,

687,"Resources are ubiquitous and sometimes exist only in certain areas. In addition, even with the same resources, production costs vary depending on the economic environment and climate characteristics of the region.

688,"If you trade, you can have things that you don't have in each country. This is also because each country specializes in producing and trading highly competitive goods, which is beneficial to each country.",,,,,,
689,"Each country has different resources that can be produced well or owns a lot, because if each country produces and trades after specializing in those resources, that is, if it trades in consideration of comparative advantage, it will generate profits in the amount of products.",,,,,,
690,"Suppose that there are countries A and B, and countries A and B produce only goods X and Y, respectively. At this time, country A has a smaller opportunity cost of producing X goods, and country B has a smaller opportunity cost of producing Y goods. If so, countries A and B will benefit more at a smaller cost by specializing in and exchanging products that each can produce at a smaller opportunity cost than by producing both X and Y goods, respectively. Therefore, countries around the world trade for this reason.",,,,,,
691,"This is because all products differ in quantity and quality in each country, so if each country specializes in comparative trade in products that can be made more efficiently, more efficient use of resources can be derived.",,,,,,
