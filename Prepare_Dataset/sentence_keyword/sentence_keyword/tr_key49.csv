529,The heat is concentrated in the hot pot and the temperature rises.,,,
530,A lot of sunlight gathers in the thick middle and generates enough energy to burn paper.,,,
531,"When the sunlight of the convex lens passes, it gathers at the focal point, which is a virtual point.  Therefore, if paper is close to the place where light gathers, a large amount of heat can be generated and a fire can occur.",,,
532,"Sunlight refracts toward one focus and gathers in focus. Therefore, the thermal energy of the focus increases. If there is any combustible material, such as paper, at that point, the sun catches fire. It would be very bad for eye health if there were eyes in that part of the focus.",,,
533,"As sunlight is refracted and collected through the convex lens, the area where the light is collected and coming in will become hot",,,
534,Sunlight gathers in one spot. It can burn paper or fallen leaves.,,,
535,"Because the middle part is thicker than the edge part, it has the property of refracting light, so light can be collected in the middle.  When light is collected, the part that receives the collected light receives a large amount of light energy, so it can be heated and even lit.",,,
536,"Because the center is thicker than the edge, if the direction of the light is gathered to one side to collect sunlight, the temperature of the collected sunlight will be hotter",,,
537,"Sunlight is a very strong light. If you collect the amount of energy that can heat the entire Earth even when it is spread through a convex lens, you will be able to do things that require a lot of heat energy, such as making a fire with a strong concentration of energy or heating food.",,,
538,"Light energy is collected at the focal point of the lens, converted into thermal energy, and the temperature of the focal point where light gathers increases.",,,
539,"When sunlight passes through a convex lens, light will be able to converge into the focus and gather more solar energy in a narrow space.",,,
540,"It refracts light and brings it together into a single point, and when you focus on black paper under the sun, it's used to burn something and raise the temperature, as an example of the paper burning around that part",,,

542,I don't remember the knowledge of convex lenses,,,
543,"Solar radiation energy gathers in one place due to the refraction of the convex lens, and it heats up as it gathers in one place. If paper, which is a material for burning, is placed in a place where sunlight is collected with a convex lens, energy gathers and reaches the firing temperature, causing a fire.",,,
544,The sunlight refracts and gathers in one spot.,,,
545,"When you collect sunlight with convex lenses, the lenses on the receiving side refract the light and change the path outward, and the lenses on the opposite side change the path back in, eventually converging the sunlight into a single point, which can help create fire or look closely at matter.",,,
546,"Light passing through the edge of the convex lens is refracted sideways, and light passing through the center is incident in a straight line.  Therefore, it serves to collect light incident from various directions into one point. The energy of light is the same, but the energy of light per unit area is very high because the range in which it acts is reduced to one point. It can also burn other objects.",,,
547,"Light refracts to the slower side, and when light from the air enters the lens, it slows down in the middle, which is relatively thicker than at the edge, so the light refracts to the middle. Therefore, sunlight can concentrate light energy and thermal energy into one part by gathering into the middle part.",,,
548,"Convex lenses have the property of collecting light into one place. Therefore, when light is collected using a convex lens, light gathers in one place and generates heat. As heat is generated, the part where light is collected may catch fire or cause soot.",,,
549,"When sunlight is collected with convex lenses, sunlight gathers at one point.  The light passing through the top of the convex lens is refracted in a downward direction, the center is refracted in a straight line, and the bottom is refracted in an upward direction, so that light gathers at one point.",,,
550,"When sunlight is collected through a convex lens, light is collected in one focus. If you continue to shine sunlight on the convex lens, a large amount of heat will be collected in one focus. If this heat gathers more than a certain level, a fire is expected.",,,
551,"A convex lens refracts light and passes through a point, and this property can collect sunlight. Because of this, it is possible to collect brighter light than the surroundings.",,,

1074,Sunlight gathers at one point and the material underneath burns.,,,
1075,"The sunlight, which originally spread over a large area, is refracted by convex lenses, which concentrates on a smaller area, and the narrow area where the sunlight touches is heated at a faster rate.",,,
1076,"Because convex lenses have the property of refracting light to the thick side of the lens, light gathers and the temperature is concentrated in one place. Therefore, there is smoke or fire.",,,
1077,The light gathers and the gathering place heats up. There will be a fire in the end.,,,
1078,It can be hot and on fire!,,,
1079,"Because light refraction occurs in convex lenses, when sunlight is collected, the light gathers at a point and over time, the temperature of the area rises, generating heat, which can cause a fire (in the case of paper, the area burns black)",,,
1080,"Sunlight will gather and heat will be concentrated in one place. If the temperature of the point where heat is collected increases and lasts for a long time, a fire may occur.",,,
1081,"Collecting sunlight with convex lenses increases the brightness and temperature of the area. . As light passes through the lens, it is bent toward the thick side of the lens because the center of the lens is thicker than the edge, so the light is bent toward the center of the lens.",,,
1082,"All sunlight directed to the convex lens gathers in the middle of the lens, becoming one strong light. Therefore, stronger light and heat will be generated than when light is dispersed. When I was young, I did a science experiment on magnifying glass. It was an activity where a magnifying glass was placed on a white paper to shine sunlight, and the results of the experiment at that time are still memorable. The paper became more and more scorched, and eventually a fire broke out. Perhaps if I had been shining on my hand, my hand would have burned.",,,
1083,"The sunlight that passes through the convex lens gathers in focus. Through this, it can be seen that the convex lens has a characteristic of collecting light. Thus, if you collect sunlight with a convex lens, it will be gathered into one part, and if a lot of light is exposed to a certain space for a long time, only a certain part will be heated. In other words, certain parts where light is gathered will be burned by heat.",,,
1084,"When light is refracted with a convex lens to pass through a point to collect light, the area of light collected becomes smaller when sunlight is collected with a convex lens, and the brightness of that part becomes brighter. Also, the temperature of the sunlight collection increases.",,,
1085,"As sunlight passes through the convex lens, the light deflects inward from the center and gathers into focus. At this time, if there is a substance that can be burned, such as paper, at the point where light gathers, the substance can burn and cause a fire.",,,
1086,"A convex lens refracts incoming light so that the focus is focused in one direction. Therefore, using a convex lens, light can be collected in one direction. Therefore, when sunlight is collected with convex lenses, light can gather in one direction and ignite it.",,,
1087,"When light is incident in a direction parallel to the plane where the convex lens is erected, it is concentrated in the middle of the convex lens with a relatively large density to create a focus. The temperature at the focal point will rise.",,,
1088,"The convex lens refracts and collects light because the center of the lens is thicker than the edge. Therefore, it is possible to collect sunlight with a convex lens and apply hotter heat than usual where the sunlight passes through this lens. For example, if you place the paper underneath the convex lens and let the sunlight shine, the paper can burn with increasing heat.Sunlight gathers, heat from sunlight gathers, so it can be used to heat up.",,,
1089,"Convex lenses are thick in the middle, so they have the property of collecting them into one point. The solar energy gathered in such a way gradually increases the temperature of that part and concentrates heat. At this time, if you put paper or wood, which is a burning substance, concentrated heat causes a fire.",,,
1090,"A convex lens has a convex thicker center than an edge of the lens. Thus, when sunlight passes through the convex lens, the light refracts and bends toward the center and gathers.",,,
1091,"When light gathers, heat is generated and if the heat persists, it can burn any small material. Combustion using larger convex lenses will reduce the use of fossil fuels currently in use, which will save energy and reduce environmental pollution.",,,
1092,"There will be a fire in the middle. Because convex lenses have the property of refracting light, sunlight refracts and passes when sunlight is reflected, and convex lenses have the property of collecting light, so light is refracted toward the focus and light will gather in one place. At this time, energy is generated as light gathers momentarily, which will generate heat and cause fire.",,,
1093,"One interesting experiment is that when sunlight is collected with a magnifying glass, it catches fire. Magnifying glasses are also a typical example of convex lenses. It can be seen that when sunlight is collected with convex lenses, sunlight is collected and caught on fire.",,,
1094,"The convex lens is refracted to a central portion where the incident light is thicker than the edge of the lens. Therefore, when sunlight is collected with a convex lens, the intensity of light becomes stronger than before sunlight is collected.",,,
