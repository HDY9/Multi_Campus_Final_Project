,"4. Hyunjin went to the swimming pool with his friends on a hot summer day. When I came out for a while after swimming excitedly with my friends, my body suddenly trembled and felt cold. Why did Hyunjin feel nervous and cold when he came out of the water even though it was a hot summer day? Let's talk about changes in the state of matter.",q59_evaporation,q59_heat ,q59_vaporization heat ,q59_cold
0,I don't know.,,,,
1,I don't understand.,,,,
2,"As water evaporates, it evaporates through the body temperature, so the body loses heat",,,,
3,It's because the temperature suddenly changed,,,,
4,The water temperature is lower than the body temperature,,,,
5,My body trembles because I've been in the water for a long time,,,,
6,I don't know.,,,,
7,Kiki.,,,,
8,Wind,,,,
9,The body feels cold because the temperature of the water is adjusted to the temperature of the water and it is different from the water,,,,
10,Because it touches the air.,,,,
11,This is because the body's heat escapes as the water evaporates.,,,,
12,My body temperature suddenly got cold,,,,
13,The body temperature decreases because the water dries and the body temperature escapes.,,,,
14,Because your body temperature changes when you come out of the water,,,,
15,The water was wrapped around us warmly and it gets cold when it disappears.,,,,
16,"When water evaporates, it evaporates with the heat in my body",,,,
17,"I stayed in low-temperature water for a long time, so my body temperature got lower",,,,
18,"As the water dries, the body heat goes away, too",,,,
19,"When I was in the water, I got used to the cold temperature of the water, but when it suddenly came out, the temperature change was high.",,,,
20,"When the water comes out of the water, the body trembles and feels cold because the body temperature drops rapidly as the water dries.",,,,
21,I don't know,,,,
22,This is because the body's moisture vaporizes and releases energy.,,,,
23,"As the liquid turns into a gas, the energy absorption plate occurs. Because water absorbs body temperature and turns into gas, it becomes cold when it comes out of water.",,,,
24,I feel cold for a while because my body got cold while I was in the water,,,,
25,The temperature has changed,,,,
26,Adjusted to the temperature of the water,,,,
27,"If we come out when our bodies are watery, we can get chills even in summer because the water dries up when we meet the temperature outside.",,,,
28,I have water on my skin,,,,
29,"This is because if you go outside with water on your body, the effect works even in summer as it is cold.",,,,

32,This is because the temperature in water and outside are different.,,,,
33,"As the water came out of the water, it became cold because of the wind.",,,,
34,The temperature inside the water and outside are different,,,,
35,"It was warm in the water, but it was warmer outside than in the water.",,,,
36,"If you stay in the water, it warms your body with a sun comb.",,,,
37,Your body temperature decreases because you stay in cold water for a long time,,,,
38,Water took HYUNJIN's body temperature away,,,,
39,This is because the body temperature is taken away as the water evaporates.,,,,
40,It's because water evaporates and your body temperature is taken away,,,,
41,"""It's because water evaporates and takes away the body's heat!",,,,
42,"""",,,,
43,"If I stay in the water, I can get used to it. I can't get used to it when it comes out of the water",,,,
44,"When you are in water, you feel cold because the temperature of the water changes suddenly when you go outside.",,,,
45,It's cold when the temperature changes suddenly because the temperature changes,,,,
46,The temperature inside and outside the water is different,,,,
47,This is because body temperature drops while drying water.,,,,
48,My body adapted to the water,,,,
49,Because there is water in the body,,,,
50,I have water on my body,,,,
51,"This is because the body temperature is high before entering the water, but after entering the cold water, the body temperature decreases",,,,
52,This is because even the wind with cold water feels cold.,,,,
53,This is because the body temperature drops as the water dries.,,,,
54,This is because the water is absorbed as it dries and the body temperature cools.,,,,
55,"It is because our body is cool, but when we enter a swimming pool with a lot of human temperature and come up to the ground where there are no people attached, there is a change in body temperature It's got to do with nerves",,,,
56,The sea is cold,,,,
57,The temperature is adjusted to the water,,,,
58,I feel cold because I was in the water and suddenly came out,,,,
59,The temperature outside is cold because the water gets used to the temperature and the body gets used to it after a long time,,,,
60,"My body was adjusted to cold water, but as soon as I came out, there was a temperature difference.",,,,
61,The temperature suddenly changed and my body was shocked.,,,,
62,This is because the temperature suddenly changed when I got out because I got used to the temperature of the water.,,,,
63,"If you stay in water for a long time, the temperature changes suddenly because your body fits that temperature",,,,
64,The water that was in your body was released,,,,
65,"I adjusted to the temperature in the water, but I couldn't adjust to the temperature outside",,,,
66,It's because the water evaporates and escapes with Hyunjin's temperature difference,,,,
67,"The water warmed my temperature, but it was cold because the water dried up.",,,,
68,"Water has a role in taking away body temperature, and as it came out of the water, water took away body temperature.",,,,
69,"This is because when water evaporates, it takes away heat by tile heat.",,,,
70,"We live with the temperature of the air before we enter the pool, but when we enter the water, we adapt to the temperature of the net. And when I come out, I think it's cold because I can't adjust to the outside temperature.",,,,
71,"When you get out of the water after adjusting to the temperature in the water, the temperature in the body is still suitable for the temperature in the water, and the temperature outside the body is different, so it is colder when the water dries.",,,,
72,"This is because as the water dries and evaporates, the body temperature that Hyun-jin had escapes with water.",,,,
73,"Drying water means that water evaporates, and when water evaporates, body temperature flies away with water.",,,,
74,at a change of temperature,,,,
75,Because water absorbs heat from the body,,,,
76,I think Hyunjin's body got cold because the water in his body got cold,,,,
77,absorption of heat of vaporization,,,,
78,The water evaporated and HYUNJIN took out the temperature,,,,
79,"As the water vaporizes, it takes heat from the body",,,,
80,I think it's cold because the water on the body evaporates due to vaporization and absorbs the heat around it,,,,
81,through evaporation,,,,
82,This is because the water disappears due to the vaporization phenomenon when it comes out while adjusting to the temperature of the water.,,,,
83,Because it vaporizes,,,,
84,Because of the vaporization,,,,
85,I was in a cold place and suddenly came out and got sunlight on my skin,,,,
86,due to vaporization,,,,
87,"Because water absorbs heat from the body to become water vapor due to vaporization,",,,,
88,"As liquid water vaporizes, it takes body temperature and flies away",,,,

91,The water absorbs the heat around it to evaporate,,,,
92,Water absorbs heat from the surroundings to vaporize,,,,
93,"When liquid water vaporizes, it absorbs the heat around it and feels cold",,,,
94,I don't know,,,,
95,"In order for water (liquid) to turn into a gas, it has to absorb heat, because the water on the body absorbed the heat in its body temperature",,,,
96,The water on the body is absorbed by the air and at the same time it feels cold,,,,
97,It's because I couldn't adapt quickly to the sudden temperature change,,,,
98,"When you come out of the park while swimming, it gets colder because your body dries in the waterIt's because it's windy to be in the liquid water and then suddenly meet the gas and dry it",,,,
99,"My body temperature, which was set in the water, does not match the temperature outside the water.",,,,
100,Because the body temperature of the water and the body temperature outside the water change significantly,,,,
101,"This is because the temperature in the water is low, but if you suddenly go to a place with a high temperature, your body gets cold",,,,
102,This is because matter absorbs or releases heat and energy when conditions change.,,,,
103,I felt cold because the water was on my body and dried.,,,,
104,"Because the water temperature of the swimming pool and the temperature outside are different, I feel cold outside because I can't adapt when I come out.",,,,
105,This is because there is a difference between the temperature of the water and the temperature outside.,,,,
106,It is because water on the body permeates the body coldly.,,,,
107,This is because the body could not adapt as the temperature suddenly increased.,,,,
108,It is cold because the body temperature adjusted to water comes out after being in water and the water changes into gas and evaporates,,,,
109,"This is because when you come out with water on your face, your body temperature rises.",,,,
110,It gets cold because the water is about to evaporate into the gas.,,,,
111,feel cold with one's hands and feet blowing,,,,
112,The water evaporates and gets cold,,,,
113,The temperature of the water in the pool and the temperature of the air outside are different. It gets cold because it gets watery when you go outside,,,,
114,Because the temperature difference is severe,,,,
115,This is because water evaporates when it meets warm air.,,,,
116,"The body is suddenly cold because the water evaporates into the sky, so the body shakes and is cold.",,,,
117,It's because the body temperature drops when you're in the water,,,,

125,"Hyunjin's condition changed from the swimming pool to the air, so such a change occurs.",,,,
126,This is because the water cools down and takes away the body's,,,,
127,"When you enter the water, heat moves from the human body to the water, and when it comes out of the water,",,,,
128,It goes from solvent to solute,,,,
129,My body's heat is gone,,,,
130,"It's been in the water for a long time, so the temperature goes down",,,,
131,It was because I was in a cold zone and suddenly I was exposed to a place where the temperature difference was severe,,,,
132,"This is because there is no air in the water, and when the body set to the water temperature came out, it met cold air.",,,,
133,"While in the pool, the temperature becomes similar to that of the water, so when you leave the pool, you feel cold when the water in the body evaporates because the temperature outside and the body temperature are different.",,,,
134,The water is dry,,,,
135,"This is because when we go out of the pool, the water in our bodies evaporates and heat is released.",,,,
136,"Water is lower in temperature than a person's body, so the person's body temperature is taken away by water",,,,
137,"I need heat to dry the water, but it is cold when the water dries because of the heat in my body.",,,,
138,"When the water dries, it gets dry",,,,
139,It's because my body is cold,,,,

141,.,,,,
142,"Because water evaporates with heat as it dries, it feels cold when it comes out of the water.",,,,
143,"When it comes out of water, it dries up and becomes a gaseous upper body in a liquid state. Therefore, you feel cold as the object that was originally attached to the body and heat transferred disappears.",,,,
144,"This is because the body was only adapted to water, but suddenly came out of the water and the body did not adapt quickly.",,,,
145,This is because the heat in the body moved to water.,,,,
146,"Because the temperature of the water is different from the temperature outside,",,,,
147,"Since water has a lower temperature than our body, entering the swimming pool, which is lower than our own temperature, will lower the body temperature. Even though it's a hot summer day, I think it's colder when the water dries because it comes out in a cold state again.",,,,
148,"Because of the temperature difference,",,,,
149,"When the water dries, it takes away your body's temperature",,,,
150,I'm already used to the temperature of my body in the pool,,,,
151,"When I came outside, the temperature was lower than the temperature in the water",,,,
