1105,"The convex lens looks different depending on the position of the object. Specifically, when an object is closer than the focus, the object appears to be larger than the real object. It looks big because there is a virtual image behind the object.

However, when viewed with a plane glass, it is expressed in the same size and direction as the object by the straightness of light.",,

If the distance between the eye and the convex lens is longer than the length of an arm and the distance between the convex lens and the object is about a span, the object is large and straight.

1115,"A convex lens is a lens in which the center portion of the lens is thicker than the edge portion. On the other hand, the planar glass is a glass with no difference in thickness. When viewed through a convex lens, if an object is close to it, light will gather closer than the focal point and the object will be enlarged, and the farther the object is, the smaller the size of the object will be. However, planar glass with no difference in thickness, such as convex lenses, looks the same as an object because light is not refracted and directed, so that light does not gather or spread.",,
