Although foreign powers were ousted due to the Nadang War, there is a limit in that they did not advance to the northern part of the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria, which were the northern part of the former Goguryeo territory, and thus did not achieve complete reunification of the three countries in terms of territory and population.",,,,,

879,"After a 30-year hiatus, Balhae (698-926) was built in the old Goguryeo territory of Manchuria, which was not occupied by Silla. The period when Silla and Balhae coexisted is called the period of the North-South Korean Empire. For this reason, the first unified country of the Korean people is Goryeo, not Silla, and Silla's ""Unification of the Three Kingdoms"" is a wrong expression, and some argue that it should be renamed as Silla's ""Dismantle of the Three Kingdoms,"" ""Unification of the Korean Peninsula,"" or ""Dismantle of the Three Kingdoms."" However, it is difficult to see the two cases differently based on the incompleteness of the northern territories of Goryeo, as well as the former Goguryeo and Balhae territories and populations did not integrate much like Silla.",,,,,

So, he entered the Tang Sinha costume and planned a coalition, claiming to be a subordinate state of the Party, and the terms were to divide the Baekje-Goguryo-Land. From Silla's point of view, the goal was to occupy the Honam Plain and the Han River basin, and the Tang Dynasty was mainly to seek revenge on Goguryeo and absorb the Korean Peninsula from King Gwanggaeto. To be honest, the reason why China still hates Korea is that Tibet and Uighur absorb into China, but I don't like the fact that only the Korean Peninsula is not absorbed at the end of the continent and that a small country maintains its independence as a country. Silla eventually defended the Korean Peninsula with the Battle of Maesoseong and said it was unification, but in fact, it is a half-digit unification, and people say that it is not the unification of the Three Kingdoms, but ""Baekje Occupation and Goguryeo Partial Occupation>. Since then, Balhae has been built by Daejoyeong, and the Manchurian Plain has become the owner of the Korean people again, but it is different from Goguryeo. Goguryeo was mainly operated around Pyongyang, Daedong River, and Joha castles, but Balhae was operated around Baekdusan Mountain.
