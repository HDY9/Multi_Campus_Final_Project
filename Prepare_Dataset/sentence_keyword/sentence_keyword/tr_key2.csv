,"2. I bought a winter heating device, and I heard that it is better to install it at the bottom of the classroom, not on the wall of the classroom, to make the entire classroom warm. Let's explain in detail why it's good to install a heating device at the bottom of the classroom using our knowledge of the movement of heat in the gas. ",q2_convection,q2_density difference

3,"Warm air is low in density, so it goes up",,
4,"Warm air goes up and cold air goes down, so air conditioners are recommended to be installed above and hot air fans on the bottom.",,
5,This is because warm air moves up and cold air moves down.,,
6,"Cold air sinks due to its high density, and warm air floats upward due to its low density. It is efficient to install a heating device at the bottom because cold air must be heated to circulate air.",,
7,Warm air moves up,,
8,"This is because warm air is denser than cold air, so warm air goes down and cold air goes up.",,
9,It is because hot air goes up because of its low density.,,
10,"Warm wind goes up, so it should be installed underneath so that all the air gets warm as it goes up from below.",,
11,"Hot air has the characteristic of going up from bottom to bottom, so it is efficient to install it underneath.",,
12,"Since the cold air sinks downward due to the convection phenomenon of the gas, it is recommended to install a heating machine downward.",,
13,"Heat can move from bottom to top by convection, making the whole warm.",,
14,"This is because when installed on the floor according to the principle of convection, the cold air at the bottom heats up again, and the cold air sinks back to the floor.",,
15,"Since the hot wind goes down and the cold wind goes up, it is advantageous to install the heating device at the bottom.",,
16,"Hot air is lighter than cold air, so you have to install it at the bottom so that warm air comes up from the bottom and gets warm quickly",,
17,This is because the heat from the heating appliance rises from bottom to top by convection.,,
18,This is because warm air is light and goes up.,,
19,Gas should be installed below because warm gases are raised by convection.,,
20,Warm air can warm the entire classroom because it has the property of going up.,,
21,This is because the gas has a property of facing upward as the temperature increases.,,
22,This is because hot air has the property of trying to rise above cold air.,,
23,The warm wind goes up^ The cold wind comes down.,,
24,"When heating devices are installed at the bottom, the entire classroom is warmed by convection caused by density differences.",,
25,"This is because when heating devices are installed at the bottom of the classroom, warm air below the classroom moves toward the cold air above the classroom by convection.",,
26,Warm air goes up and cold air goes down,,
27,"This is due to convection. Basically, warm liquid-gas has the property of going up and cold liquid-gas has the property of going down. When a heating device is installed at the bottom of the classroom, the air below becomes warm and goes up, and the cold air above goes down, and as it heats up again, gas circulation occurs. Therefore, it is better to install it below the top",,
28,The warm air goes up,,
29,"The movement of heat in a gas is carried by convection in which the gas molecules move directly, and the higher temperature gas floats upward in one space due to its lower density. Therefore, convection is efficient only when the heat source is located below.",,
30,The heat is coming out.,,

40,I don't know.,,
41,I don't know.,,
42,"Like the boiler you have at home now, it is recommended to warm the floor to the ceiling and install it from the floor.",,
43,This is because warm air goes up quickly like steam goes up and the heat spreads quickly.,,
44,I think it's because the whole classroom is filled with warm air when the heat rises from the bottom.,,
45,"That way, the wind comes out and the heat comes out, so it gets warm",,
46,I don't know.,,
47,"If you warm the floor first, the warm air spreads over the floor, making it warmer",,
48,I'm trying to be warm downstairs,,
49,My feet are cold,,
50,This is because the gas is warm air goes up.,,

53,The hot air goes up,,
54,The hot air goes up,,
55,This is because the gas is warm air goes up.,,
56,This is because hot gases rise every time the convection occurs.,,
57,Warm air goes up and cold air. Because it goes down and circulates with each other,,
58,Because the cold heat goes down and the warm heat goes up,,
59,"The warm air goes up, so it's nice to be warmer from the top of us",,
60,The hot air goes up,,
61,"Because hot air is more dense than cold air, it heats up faster",,
62,"Warm air is light and floats upward, so when you install a heating device at the bottom, the warm air at the bottom rises and the air circulates, making it evenly warm everywhere.",,
63,heat transfer,,
64,"If you install the air conditioner on top, the cold air goes down, and if you install the stove underneath, the hot air goes up, so gas exchange occurs",,
65,Air goes up as the temperature goes up,,
66,This is because hot air goes down and cold air goes up and circulates.,,

73,"Warm air goes down and cold air goes up, so to let warm air go down,",,
74,Warm air goes up to your teeth,,
75,Warm temperatures should be installed on the floor of the classroom because they are intended to go up.,,
76,"Since warm air circulates from bottom to top and cold air from top to bottom, heating devices must be installed at the bottom to move heat quickly.",,
77,"Hot air goes up, so you have to cover the cold air below",,
78,I don't understand.,,

95,Warm heat goes up and goes around,,
96,"Warm air goes up, so it is installed on the Are side to raise the air.",,
97,"Hot air is light and goes up, so when installed underneath, hot air goes up and when the air above comes down, it circulates.",,
98,It seems to be because the warm gas came up from the bottom and quickly heated the large area in the classroom.,,
99,This is because hot air goes up.,,
100,"This is because hot air has the property of going up, so if you install it at the bottom, the air on the top gets warm, too",,
101,"Hot air tends to move up and cold air moves down. With this theory, hot air balloon lights were also be built.This situation is also because warm air comes out of the heating system, so it should be installed underneath to warm the entire classroom as the hot air circulates through the air.",,
