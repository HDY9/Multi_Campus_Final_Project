0,I don't know.,,,,
1,It's very responsive,,,,
2,Low boiling point and remains gaseous at room temperature,,,,
3,To make the volume smaller,,,,
4,"This is because if stored in a gaseous state, all of them will be blown away.",,,,
5,This is because the boiling point of butane gas is low at room temperature,,,,
6,I don't understand.,,,,
7,Low boiling point and cannot be stored as liquid at room temperature,,,,
8,This is because the heat of vaporization generated when a liquid becomes a gas absorbs ambient heat.,,,,
9,for storage,,,,
10,Beutane in a gaseous state is stored in a liquid state with low reactivity because it has high reactivity.,,,,
11,"At the same amount, the volume of the gas is larger than the volume of the liquid, so it must be stored as a liquid to store it in less space.",,,,
12,"Since it is stored in a high pressure state, a combustible gas such as butane gas can be used relatively safely.",,,,
13,This is because gases react with other substances.,,,,
14,"As the pressure is lowered, the gas maintained in a liquid state by the high pressure expands again and becomes gas.",,,,
15,"It exists as a liquid because of the pressure of pressing butane gas, but if it exists as a liquid, the distance between molecules and molecules is very short, so it does not catch fire easily in a liquid state.",,,,
16,"Gas is bulky and difficult to carry around, so it is carried in a small liquid state",,,,
17,It exploded,,,,
18,This is because it needs to be liquid to prevent deterioration as much as possible.,,,,
19,The liquid is less reactive.,,,,
20,"To prevent it from expanding and bursting,",,,,
21,"Since the gas is larger in volume than the liquid, when stored in a gaseous state, it is stored in a smaller amount than when stored in a liquid state.",,,,
22,I doubt it.,,,,
23,It is easy to store and can contain more liquid. (The volume of the liquid is smaller than the volume of the gas.) You can see how much is left by shaking the butane gas.,,,,
24,"Since the gas is denser than the liquid, storing the gas in a liquid state can store a relatively larger amount.",,,,
25,This is because the volume occupied when a substance exists as a liquid is smaller than when it exists as a gas.,,,,
26,"When you're in a liquid state, it's denser than when you're in a gaseous state",,,,
27,"The reason for storing in a liquid state is to contain a larger amount.  A liquid has less space between molecules than a gas. It is also stored as a liquid, not a gas, because it is easy to change its state into a gas.",,,,
28,I can put a lot more in here,,,,
29,"If gaseous fuel is stored in a liquid state, a large amount of capacity can be stored in a small volume, and gaseous fuel can guarantee stability because combustion occurs mainly in a gaseous state.",,,,

60,It prevents substances from flying away,,,,
61,Because it's easy to burst when it's made of gas,,,,
62,"Since gases are greatly affected by temperature and pressure, they can burst or swell if they are wrong, so they are stored in a liquid state where molecular motion is relatively inactive.",,,,
63,butane gas,,,,
64,"If you do it in a gaseous state instead of a liquid state, it explodes as soon as the outside is hot or the butane gas catches fire",,,,
65,to increase storage capacity,,,,
66,"It's because if you're in a can as a gas, all the gas can leak out",,,,
67,I don't know,,,,

74,Butane gas is used to light a fire.,,,,
75,Gas is harder to store than liquid,,,,
76,Butane gas is liquid and does not burn when it hits flammable materials.,,,,
77,Because you can get more pure substances,,,,

95,Gas seems to become liquid because it slowly changes over time,,,,
96,Because liquid states have less impact and can store more volume than gas states.,,,,
97,"The gas is invisible and it's hard to see what's in the container, but the exche is easy to see and how much is in the container",,,,
98,"This is because the gas slowly falls out, so it does not fall out when it is set as a liquid.",,,,
99,"When the gas is liquefied, the distance between the particles is narrowed, allowing more butane gas to be stored.",,,,
100,"Gas has the properties of being far away from each other, but liquids tend to stick together, so it seems to use liquids to put large amounts in small spaces",,,,
101,"The gases are far away from each other. On the other hand, since liquids have the property of being lumped together, they can be put in the same space with a larger volume than gases, so I think they are used like this.",,,,

792,,,,,
793,,,,,
794,,,,,
795,All gases are the same. You have to have enough power to beat atmospheric pressure to get into a gas state.,,,,
796,,,,,
797,"However, as the pressure increases, the pressing force on the molecules in the liquid state becomes stronger, making it difficult to become a gas. The higher the pressure, the more... This means that molecules of butane gas must have high energy to become gases.",,,,
798,I don't know,,,,
799,a solid preparation,,,,
800,Liquids can store more matter than gases,,,,
801,So that it doesn't fly away,,,,
802,It is to facilitate storage.,,,,
803,I don't know.,,,,
804,This is because there is less volume per unit area of liquid than gas.,,,,
805,Because it evaporates in the air when stored in the air,,,,
806,To add more,,,,
807,I don't know,,,,
808,To put in more,,,,
809,"This is because if butane gas is made up of only gas, it loses its efficiency because it loses gas quickly",,,,
810,I don't know.,,,,
811,.,,,,
812,Because the effects vary depending on the substance,,,,
813,?,,,,
814,To make it easier for substances to get in,,,,
815,To keep,,,,
816,I don't know,,,,
817,That's how it works,,,,
818,God created it like that,,,,
819,I don't know.,,,,
820,The gas is too bulky.,,,,
821,It is gasified outside of liquefaction at a low speed,,,,
822,Decompose butane gas,,,,
823,I don't know.,,,,
824,Because the volume decreases,,,,
825,"The distance between liquid particles is narrower than the distance between gas particles, so the volume is smaller in liquid than in gas. And the gas floats around, so it cannot be packaged or packaged.",,,,
826,Gas is easy to disappear from that space.,,,,
827,"If it's in a gaseous state, it can explode or cause of explosion or fire",,,,
828,It's the same principle that applying the right amount of heat to the ex-body becomes water vapor,,,,
829,Arkites in,,,,
830,"If it is in a gaseous state, it is stored in a liquid state for storage because the volume is too large.",,,,
831,.,,,,
832,I don't know.,,,,
833,Because it's light,,,,
834,I don't know. It's annoying.,,,,
835,I don't know.,,,,
836,Is there a high risk of bursting if you store it in gas?,,,,
837,It's weak,,,,
838,"In a gaseous state, it explodes when it meets the air",,,,
839,The liquid doesn't change very well,,,,
840,To reduce the volume,,,,
841,It is a method for easily transporting a large amount of butane gas in a small container because it can become a liquid by increasing the pressure of the gas,,,,
842,d,,,,
843,I don't understand.,,,,
844,"The liquid state is smaller in volume than the gas state, so it can be stored more",,,,
845,This is because you can save more.,,,,
846,The difference in density between gas and liquid is huge,,,,
847,This is because the gas can store more volumeOh,,,,
848,I don't know.,,,,
849,It's perfect!,,,,
850,It's to store a larger amount.,,,,
851,This is because it occupies a large volume if it exists in a gaseous state.,,,,
852,This is because it increases in volume.,,,,
853,Gas is bulky and difficult to store.,,,,
854,"It exists in a liquid state under high pressure, but it is converted into gas because the pressure decreases while leaving butane gas.",,,,
855,Gas is bulky and difficult to store.,,,,
856,"Since the volume of the gas is larger than the volume of the liquid, when stored as a liquid, a larger amount can be stored.",,,,
857,It's easy to store,,,,
858,I don't know.,,,,
859,This is because the volume of the gas in the same space is larger than the liquid.,,,,
860,This is because there is a risk of bursting if stored in a gas.,,,,
861,"""",,,,
862,"Gas is extremely large in volume than liquid or solid, so it is inefficient to put it in a container in a gaseous state and store it in a liquid state.",,,,
863,"Gas is in a state where the distance between molecules is very far apart, and liquid is arranged irregularly, and the density of liquid is much higher than that of the gas. Therefore, if butane gas is stored in a liquid state at high pressure, it is easy to carry around, so it is stored in a liquid state.",,,,
864,"Because gases are larger in volume than liquids, they are stored in a liquid state to hold more fuel in a limited volume of butane gas cylinders.",,,,
865,"Because gases are larger in volume than liquids, they are stored in a liquid state to hold more fuel in a limited volume of butane gas cylinders.",,,,
866,Gas is stored in a liquid state with a small volume change because it is not suitable for storage due to its large volume and large volume change depending on temperature.,,,,
867,"This is because it is more disadvantageous than liquid storage to determine whether it has leaked or how much remains are left. This is because the liquid phase has a greater intermolecular attraction than the gaseous phase, so it exists in a visible state.",,,,
868,"The liquid is smaller in volume than the gas, so it is easy to carry around.",,,,
869,I don't know,,,,
870,I don't know.,,,,
871,I don't know,,,,
872,The reason for storing gas-based substances in a liquid state is that it is better to store them in a liquid because the mass of the same volume of gas and liquid is higher.,,,,
873,"In the case of gas, the bond between particles is unstable, the particle is small, so there is a high possibility of leakage, and it is difficult to store the gas due to its large volume.",,,,
874,for stabilization,,,,
875,"Most substances, except water, have larger volumes in the order of solid, liquid, and gas depending on their condition. The volume difference between the liquid and the gas is very large, and for this reason, storing more butane gas fuel in a liquid can be efficiently stored than storing it in a gas.",,,,
876,I don't know,,,,
877,I don't know,,,,
878,"Since the liquid is lighter in volume than the gas,",,,,
879,"Since the liquid state is smaller in volume than in the gaseous state, it can be stored efficiently. That's why it's stored in a liquid state.",,,,
880,"In the case of gases, it is difficult to contain the desired capacity in a certain container because in the case of gases, the space between particles is very far, so the use of materials must be very large to store them in a gaseous state. Therefore, it is stored in a liquid state where the space between the particles is relatively close. Since the material stored in this way is in an unstable state, it can be converted into a gas when an impact is applied, so it can be used in the form of a gas.",,,,
881,"It puts a lot of pressure in the butane gas to convert the butane of the gas into liquid. When the gas becomes a liquid, the gap between particles becomes extremely narrow, and butane in a state of high density and small volume can be obtained. This is a great utility in our lives.",,,,
882,"When a gaseous substance is converted into a liquid state, the volume of the substance decreases. Therefore, storing the material in a liquid state can store a larger amount of material than storing the material in a gaseous state in a small container.",,,,
883,"A certain amount can be put in a fixed volume, and even if it is the same amount, it is efficient because the volume is small when stored as a liquid.",,,,
884,I don't know,,,,
885,"To minimize the volume,",,,,
886,I don't know,,,,
887,Gas is larger and more stable than liquid.,,,,
888,"The gaseous state occupies more volume than the liquid state, and when stored in a gaseous state, the volume expands due to heat and the risk of bursting is high, so it is kept in a liquid state.",,,,
889,Because the atoms are more stable than the gases,,,,
