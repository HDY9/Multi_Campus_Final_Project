One is that the temperature, which was above the ignition point, fell below the ignition point by spraying water, and the fire was extinguished.  However, in extreme cases, when the air pressure is so high that the boiling point of water is higher than the firing point of the cloth, the second case is that the combustion reaction of the cloth is stopped by blocking the oxygen supplied to the cloth. In either case or both of these cases, the fire is extinguished because they were satisfied.",,
816,"As mentioned above, the conditions to catch fire are de-material, temperature above the ignition point, and supply of sufficient oxygen. Having already caught fire means meeting these three requirements.  If you think the other way around, it means that if you block the three conditions, the fire will be extinguished. There are two reasons why the fire goes out after spraying water. First, water interferes with the binding of de-materials and oxygen, so that the fire is extinguished. Spraying water is like trapping a de-material in water, which prevents it from reacting with oxygen. The second is when the water is cold. If the water sprayed on the de-material is cold, the fire is extinguished because the water not only blocks the reaction with oxygen, but also absorbs the temperature of the de-material to lower the temperature of the de-material so that it does not meet two of the three conditions.",,
817,"In order to catch fire, we need temperatures above the ignition point, oxygen, and something to burn.",,
818,"Water will burn, so the iron plate does not disappear, so it is not an iron plate, and oxygen is not blocked at all, so I think the iron plate, which has risen to the temperature above the ignition point, has been lowered using water. As soon as water is sprayed, vaporization occurs due to the high heat of the fire. As the water changes from liquid to gas and takes in nearby heat energy, the temperature of the iron plate is lowered, so the fire is extinguished because it does not exceed the firing point.",,

The fire is weak, but it must be in their best interests. But it's so heartbreaking. The best thing is to disappear too easily.",,
821,"This is because the temperature above the ignition point was removed among the three combustion conditions mentioned above. If water is poured onto a hot iron plate, the temperature of the iron plate and the temperature of the water will be in thermal equilibrium according to the 0th law of thermodynamics, and the temperature will decrease. Therefore, the temperature is lower than the ignition point, so that the third condition of combustion is not satisfied.",,
822,"The conditions for extinguishing the fire may be artificially manipulated so as not to satisfy one of the three conditions in which the fire is generated. When water was sprayed on the lit iron plate, the surrounding oxygen was blocked to satisfy the condition of the presence of sufficient oxygen, and the condition of the temperature above the ignition point was dissatisfied. It can be said that the fire was extinguished due to this.",,
823,"If water is sprayed on the lit iron plate, the fire is extinguished because the three conditions for firing, the temperature above the ignition point, the de-material, and the temperature above the ignition point during oxygen supply are not satisfied. This is because if any of the three conditions are not satisfied, the fire will not be lit or extinguished. When relatively cold water and hot fire meet, the water takes away the heat of the fire, and the higher temperature changes it into a form of water vapor, and the reason why the fire is extinguished is that the water takes away the heat of vaporization from the fire.",,
824,"The reason why the fire was extinguished after spraying water on the lit iron plate was that it did not satisfy one of the three conditions that could catch fire: temperature above the ignition point, de-material, or oxygen supply. So what did the water block to turn off the lights? This is because the temperature was lowered below the ignition point. This is because when water is sprayed, the water becomes water vapor and absorbs the heat of vaporization that it absorbs. Therefore, when water is sprayed on a lit iron plate, the fire goes out.",,
825,"If water is sprayed on the lit iron plate, the water covers the iron plate and oxygen is not supplied properly. Therefore, the fire is extinguished because the supply of oxygen, which is one of the conditions for combustion, is not properly supplied.",,
826,The reason why the fire was extinguished after spraying water on the lit iron plate is because it is lowered to a temperature below the ignition point.,,
827,"The temperature of the iron plate reaches the ignition point of the cloth, and when the fire is about to burn, oxygen is essential, but the water does not block oxygen, but the water meets hot and changes the state and absorbs vaporization heat, so the fire goes out, whether it is hot or cold.",,
828,The reason why the fire was extinguished after spraying water on the iron plate on fire was because of the heat of vaporization.,,
829,"When water is sprayed, the water becomes a gas and absorbs vaporization heat, and thus a temperature higher than an firing point in the combustion condition is not satisfied, and the steam blocks oxygen, thereby extinguishing the fire.",,
830,"Water is evaporated by the heat of the fire on the cloth. At this time, the water is heated and the molecular motion becomes active, and the space between the molecules is separated, and since the necessary energy must be continuously supplied, the temperature of the burning cloth is taken away and evaporated, and the temperature is lowered. The fire goes out as the temperature drops below the ignition point.",,
831,"The temperature of the water is lower than that of the fire, so the temperature is lowered, and as the water is sprayed, the force is applied to press the fire under pressure.",,
832,"The burning iron plate is under fire, and the de-material, temperature above the firing point, and oxygen are satisfied. Spraying water lowers the temperature. The reason is that first, since the temperature of water is lower than the temperature of the iron plate, the temperature of the iron plate is lowered by thermal equilibrium, and the water reaching 100 degrees Celsius evaporates to absorb vaporization heat. In addition, water vapor generated as water evaporates has the effect of blocking contact with oxygen. In order for digestion to occur, only one of the three conditions of combustion mentioned above is not satisfied, so when water is sprayed, the fire is extinguished.",,
