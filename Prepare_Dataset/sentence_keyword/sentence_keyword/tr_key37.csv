0,There's a lot of oxygen,,,,
1,This is because the pressure of the air increases.,,,,
2,The pressure is getting stronger,,,,
3,I think it's swollen because it's vinyl,,,,
4,because of the pressure,,,,
5,It's full of nitrogen and there's nothing to eat,,,,
6,I think it is because I get close to the sky when I go to a high mountain,,,,
7,Because of the pressure,,,,
8,I'm running out of course,,,,
9,"This is because as the air cools, the air goes down and enters the bag.",,,,
10,It's an alpine region,,,,
11,"The more you go up, the more the wind blows",,,,
12,"There are a lot of trees in the mountain, so there is a lot of air in the bag of snacks are full of air.",,,,
13,This is because the air enters or exits.,,,,
14,"The higher the mountain, the weaker the pressure, and the bag of snacks seems to swell.",,,,
15,"It's because there's less oxygen when you climb a high mountain, so you're under pressure",,,,
16,under pressure,,,,
17,be due to the lack of oxygen,,,,
18,"The more you play, the more pressure you get",,,,
19,"Because the higher you go, the lower your family business gets.",,,,
20,"Because there is less oxygen, the force to press the snack bag outside becomes weak. (Because the air pressure is lowered)",,,,
21,It's because the pressure on the air pressure is strong.,,,,
22,Just,,,,
23,Just,,,,
24,This is because the density of the air is high.,,,,
25,It swells up because the front is low.,,,,
26,It swells up because of its high altitude.,,,,
27,It swells up because of its high altitude,,,,
28,It's because of the high altitude,,,,
29,This is because the temperature has changed.,,,,
30,The plastic bottle expanded by heat and contracted with heat,,,,
31,Because of the strong air pressure,,,,
32,Because of the weak pressure.,,,,
33,be due to a decrease in air pressure,,,,
34,"Because of the high atmospheric pressure of the mountain,",,,,
35,The air pressure and pressure of the temperature of the air in the acid.,,,,
36,Because of the high atmospheric pressure,,,,
37,It's because gravity weakens,,,,
38,It seems to swell due to atmospheric pressure,,,,
39,This is because the air pressure has increased.,,,,
40,"Because of the atmospheric pressure on the mountain,",,,,
41,Because the air is low on the top of the mountain,,,,
42,It is because of the high atmospheric pressure on the mountain.,,,,
43,This is because the front of the mountain is high.,,,,
44,It's because the air pressure is high on the mountain,,,,
45,It's because of the atmospheric pressure.,,,,
46,Because the air pressure is low,,,,
47,It's full of air,,,,
48,"Because the air is cold,",,,,
49,I'm under pressure,,,,
50,There's pressure,,,,
51,It is likely that the air pressure will increase and become full due to the pressure of the air.,,,,
52,"As the height rises, it swells up due to air pressure.",,,,
53,There's not much air left,,,,
54,Nitrogen inside is inflated by pressure,,,,
55,It's because of the pressure.,,,,
56,Air pressure causes the bag to swell,,,,
57,I don't know.,,,,
58,Because the air in the high mountains is different from the air underneath.,,,,
59,It's because there's a lot of nitrogen and oxygen coming in,,,,
60,"The higher you go, the less oxygen in the air",,,,
61,"This is because the pressure in the air increases and goes up, resulting in high pressure.",,,,
62,This is because pressure is applied.,,,,
63,This is because the air pressure is as high as when you're on an airplane.,,,,
64,The pressure of the air is high,,,,
65,Because of the high pressure,,,,
66,Because of the pressure,,,,
67,"It happened because of the pressure difference.For example, if you go up to a high place by car, your ears get blocked",,,,
68,By the wind while climbing the mountain?,,,,
69,"As the altitude increases, the air pressure decreases and the air inside the bag expands",,,,
70,"Compared to flat land, higher mountains have lower pressure and lower temperatures. T decreases with PV=nRT, but the volume increases due to a greater reduction effect of P.",,,,
71,This is to lower the ambient pressure so that the pressure inside and outside the snack bag is the same.,,,,
72,"This is because the air pressure is lowered. Assuming that the temperature is constant, the product of the pressure and volume is constant.",,,,
73,"Because the atmospheric pressure around you decreases,",,,,
74,This is because volume increases when pressure decreases by Boyle's law.,,,,
75,Volume increases as air pressure decreases,,,,
76,Because the pressure is reduced,,,,
77,due to low air pressure,,,,
78,"As the air pressure decreases, the pressure in the bag of snacks increases, and the bag of snacks swells.",,,,
79,"This is because the air pressure decreases as it goes higher from the ground, and the force received by the gases in the bag decreases, so that the gases try to expand.",,,,
80,"As you climb the high mountain, the pressure inside the bag of snacks is constant, but the pressure around it increases, so the bag of snacks swells.",,,,
81,"This is because the pressure of air in the mountain, which is higher than the pressure of air at the bottom of the mountain, is lower, so the pressure inside the bag of confectionery is higher than the pressure of air in the mountain.",,,,
82,"As the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the snack rise, the atmospheric pressure decreases, and the pressure pushed outside the snack bag decreases, but the pressure inside the snack bag swells because it is the same.",,,,
83,"High mountains have low density of air due to weak gravity. Therefore, in the mountains, the air pressure becomes relatively smaller, so the air pressure in the bag of snacks becomes relatively large and becomes larger in volume",,,,
84,"As the height increases from the ground, the magnitude of the gravity received by the air decreases, which lowers the air pressure and lowers the external air pressure, causing the air pressure in the bag to become larger than the air pressure of the outside air, so the bag swells.",,,,
85,This is because the atmospheric pressure weakens and the volume of the bag expands.,,,,
86,"As you go up to a mountain far from the ground, the air particles (molecules) are less affected by gravity, so the number of air particles (molecules) is reduced. Accordingly, the number of air particles hitting the plastic bag is reduced. Since the pressure of the gas inside the snack bag is constant, when the pressure of the external gas is reduced, the internal pressure is relatively increased, and thus the plastic bag is swollen.",,,,
87,"If you carry a bag of snacks in a high mountain, the air pressure decreases, and various gases in the bag expand, which causes the bag to swell.",,,,
88,"As the height of the ground increases, the magnitude of gravity received by the air decreases, and thus the external pressure decreases, and thus the pressure inside the snack bag increases relatively compared to the external pressure, thereby swelling.",,,,
89,"Climbing a high mountain reduces atmospheric pressure because the air is thin. As the pressure decreases, the volume of the gas increases. Therefore, the volume of gas in the bag of snacks increases as the pressure on the atmosphere decreases.",,,,
90,yes,,,,
91,"Because of atmospheric pressure differences,",,,,
92,"The higher you go, the lower the air pressure. If you bring the bag of cookies to a high mountain, the pressure outside the bag will decrease, but the inside of the bag will remain the same pressure at a low place, so the bag will swell.",,,,
93,"Since air is present on the surface by gravity, there is less air in high mountains and the air pressure is low. Therefore, the bag of confectionery, which maintained its shape at the same pressure as the high atmospheric pressure of the surface, becomes larger than the external atmospheric pressure and swells.",,,,
94,This is because the air pressure was lowered and the volume of air in the snack bag increased.,,,,
95,"As you go up, the air pressure decreases, so the pressure in the bag increases. That's why the bag of cookies to swell.",,,,
96,"As the altitude increases, the air pressure decreases, so the pressure acting on the bag decreases, and the air in the bag moves more actively, increasing the number of collisions between the bag and the bag, causing the bag to swell.",,,,
97,"When you go up to a high place, the air becomes thin and the air pressure is lowered. When the air pressure decreases, the pressure to press the snack bag also decreases, causing the snack bag to swell.",,,,
98,"High places have low air pressure because the air tries to stay low due to gravity. Therefore, since the air in the snack made at an ordinary height is lower than the air pressure in the high mountain, the volume of the air in the bag increases and the air pressure in the bag increases to become equal to the air outside.As the height increases from the ground, the distribution of air becomes thinner. When the air becomes thinner, the number of air molecules around it decreases. This means that the air pressure created by the collision of air molecules decreases. Therefore, the air pressure above the mountain is lower than the air pressure on the ground. Therefore, as the science bag, which existed in a state similar to the pressure of the ground, rises to a high mountain, the ambient air pressure decreases, and the pressure of the snack bag rises relatively high.",,,,
99,"I know that the higher you go, the lower the air pressure. So if we compare the air pressure in the low places where we usually live with the air pressure in the high mountains, the air pressure in our living quarters will be higher than the air pressure in the high mountains. When we climb a high mountain with a bag of snacks, the air pressure moves from relatively high to low. Therefore, it means that the pressure applied to nitrogen in the bag of snacks gradually decreases, so the bag of snacks swells.",,,,
100,by the pressure difference,,,,
101,The pressure and equilibrium of the air in the bag of snacks change due to the decrease in ambient air pressure in the high mountains,,,,
102,"This is because as the altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases and the pressure difference from the air in the bag of snacks is generated.",,,,
103,Because the air pressure is low,,,,
104,"With PV=nRT, the volume increases as the pressure decreases",,,,
105,Because the atmospheric pressure is low,,,,
106,I don't know.,,,,
107,"Because the air pressure gets higher,",,,,
108,"This is because the higher you go, the lower the air pressure.",,,,
109,Because of the high atmospheric pressure,,,,
110,Gas volume increases due to reduced pressure,,,,
111,Climbing a high mountain increases the pressure,,,,
112,This is because the pressure around the bag is lowered so that the gas in the bag can be more free and expand.,,,,
113,Gravity decreases and the air expands,,,,
114,"As you climb a high mountain, the pressure decreases, and the pressure to press the bag of snacks weakens and swells.",,,,
115,"The higher the terrain, the stronger the pressure",,,,
116,This is because air pressure and temperature have decreased.,,,,
117,It's because the air pressure increases as the altitude rises,,,,
118,This is because the air pressure has been lowered.,,,,
119,"The pressure in the bag is the same, but the external pressure reacts to change.",,,,
120,The air pressure changed,,,,
121,The bag of confectionary swells up because the air pressure on the high mountain is higher than at the bottom of the mountain,,,,
122,"As the altitude increases, the pressure increases and the gas in the bag expands and swells",,,,
123,"The higher the altitude, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the internal force than the external force, which causes the bag of snacks to swell.",,,,
124,This is because the air pressure decreases as it goes up higher.,,,,
125,"As you go up the mountain, it expands because the pressure outside is lower than the pressure inside the bag.",,,,
126,"First, most of the air in the atmosphere is concentrated on the ground. So the higher the altitude, the lower the air pressure per volume. So when you fill the bag of confectioners on the surface, you have the same atmospheric pressure as the atmospheric pressure of the surface. Since the air moves from high pressure to low pressure, the atmospheric pressure of the mountain, which is the pressure to press the bag of confectionery, is lower than 1 atmosphere, so the bag of confectionery, which is 1 atmosphere pressure, expands outwardly expands.",,,,
127,"As the height increases, the gas molecules become more active and the bag of confectionery swells",,,,
128,This is because the pressure in the bag increases and the ambient pressure increases.,,,,
129,"The higher you go, the lower the barometric pressure",,,,
