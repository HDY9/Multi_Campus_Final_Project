857,Lightning occurs first because the speed of light transmission is faster than that of sound.,
858,Lightning occurs first because the speed of light transmission is faster than that of sound.,
859,The light is faster than the sound,
860,This is because the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound (sonic waves).,
