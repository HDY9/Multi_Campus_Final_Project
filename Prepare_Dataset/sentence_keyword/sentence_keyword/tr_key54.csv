However, the concept of ecosystems that living things and the environment surrounding them are closely related to each other has existed since before. This concept was developed by Clementz around 1930 and proposed the concept of biome, which sees life and the environment as a kind of organism. Here, Tansley came to propose the concept of an 'ecosystem' in which biomes and a broad sense of inanimate environment interact with each other. Later, the concept of ecology and ecology was established and developed by Raymond Laurel Lindeman, Eugene Pleasants Odum, and Gordon L. Clark.",,,

In addition, things such as arable and urban ecosystems can be considered. In addition, it is divided into producers (green plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria or microorganisms) around the function of living things.

In the ecosystem, inorganic materials are synthesized as organic materials by producers, and the ecosystem is 'circulated' in the process of returning to inorganic materials through consumers and decomposers. However, the energy originating from solar energy is used as the living energy needed for living organisms through the food chain process, and the rest is transferred to the next nutritional stage, and some are lost as heat. Energy is described as 'flowing' because the lost energy is not reused by living things.

1130,To clear the air,,,
1131,That's how animals that live on live.,,,
1132,The producer gives food to the primary consumer.,,,
1133,In order for me to live,,,
1134,"This is because if producers such as grass and trees disappear, the ecosystem will collapse due to the influence of consumers and decomposers.",,,
1135,This is because there are consumers who make energy from what they consume through producers.,,,
1136,"You have to have a producer, you have a consumer, you have a decomposer. Because they have to interact with each other, there must be producers to maintain the ecosystem.",,,
1137,"This is because without producers, primary consumers, which are food for secondary consumers, will decrease, and if primary consumers decrease, secondary consumers will also decrease, breaking the balance of the ecosystem. Whatever the foundation work is important.",,,
1138,"That way, consumers can consume, and the ecosystem works through it.",,,
1139,"This is because only when there is a producer, creatures that feed on producers can survive, and only when this process is repeated can the ecosystem be achieved. If there are no producers who are part of the ecosystem, the ecosystem will eventually disappear.",,,
1140,Because consumers need food!,,,
1141,This is because only when producers exist in the ecosystem can creatures in different locations live by eating.,,,
1142,"Only producers can turn sunlight into energy.Consumers also get energy to live by consuming producers. If the producer is less than the consumer, the consumer cannot consume energy, resulting in fewer individuals.So there are more primary producers in the ecosystem than consumers.",,,
1143,"""",,,
1144,This is because the nutritional relationship of all ecosystems begins only when producers are in the ecosystem.,,,
1145,"Because the primary consumer consumes what the producer produces and the secondary consumer consumes the primary consumer, the ecosystem cannot be maintained without the producer",,,
1146,It is to provide nutrients to consumers and decomposers.,,,
1147,"Producers make their own nutrients through photosynthesis. The primary consumer eats the producer. Therefore, there needs to be a producer so that the primary consumer can buy nutrition, and the secondary consumer who eats the primary consumer can buy it.",,,
1148,"There are creatures that consume grass and trees, and there are other creatures that consume them. Since the ecosystem is formed by repeating this food chain, the most basic basis for maintaining the ecosystem is producers such as grass and trees.",,,
1149,"Without producers, the means to eat food disappears. If herbivores that eat grass or wood disappear, carnivores that eat herbivores will also disappear and eventually the ecosystem will be destroyed.",,,
1150,"The producer supplies oxygen to the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Also, producers are the prey of consumers and maintain the food chain.",,,
1151,"This is because there may be consumers who live on producers because there are producers. If one is missing or lacking in number, the ecosystem as a whole will become imbalanced, which will eventually make it difficult for producers, consumers, and decomposers to survive.",,,
1152,"It is necessary because the ecosystem is maintained by the food pyramid, such as primary consumers who consume producers such as grass and trees, and secondary consumers who consume primary consumers.",,,
1153,"There are primary consumers who live with nutrients from producers, and secondary consumers and tertiary consumers who live from such primary consumers, so all ecosystems can operate only when producers are in the ecosystem.",,,
1154,"Producers produce energy sources through light energy in living organisms, and consumers survive by feeding on these producers. If there is no producer, the life that will primarily produce energy disappears, and the life that used to use the producer to obtain energy cannot survive. If this process occurs, the balance of the entire ecosystem is broken, so producers must exist in the ecosystem.",,,
1155,"There are producers such as grass and trees in the ecosystem, so there are consumers who can consume them. Since ecosystems form organic bonds with each other, one existence can be the reason for another existence.",,,
1156,h,,,
1157,Don't know,,,
1158,Because all animals can live only when there is a producer,,,
1159,Because consumers need producers like grass and trees,,,
1160,It is for consumers to live.,,,
1161,It's for the lives of consumers,,,
1162,The consumer has to live,,,
1163,The consumer has to live,,,
1164,I don't know,,,
1165,"Without a single component, the ecosystem won't work",,,
1166,Because animals have to make ends meet,,,
1167,"Because if any of the components are missing, it won't circulate",,,
1168,Because the air and animals can be constant,,,
1169,This is because some of the animals that are consumers eat producers and earn a living.,,,
1170,Because the consumer disappears,,,
1171,Because it's all life,,,
1172,Because ecosystems interact with each other,,,
1173,"The ecological pyramid needs to be well-formed so that producers, consumers, decomposers can all live fairly",,,
1174,"Without producers, there is no food, so the ecosystem does not work well because it dies.",,,
1175,We need producers like grass and trees to balance the ecosystem,,,
1176,This is because there must be producers such as grass and trees so that the next producer can live on it.,,,
1177,"Consumers need producers to live. Without producers, ecosystems are destroyed",,,
1178,Because there needs to be producers like grass and trees so that the next producer can feed on them,,,
1179,"Consumers can survive based on producers such as grass and trees, and decomposers can survive only when consumers exist. In addition, the producer uses the nutrients decomposed by the decomposer again for his or her survival. As such, ecosystems do not exist independently of each other, but interact with each other, so if either side has a problem, it can greatly affect the entire ecosystem system.",,,
1180,That's why consumers can live off producers,,,
1181,Consumers can buy it,,,
1182,That's right. The first producer comes out,,,
1183,and consumers can buy it,,,
1184,",,",,,
1185,This is because production is necessary to consume.,,,
1186,Because there are consumers only when there are producers,,,
1187,"This is because animals can eat and live, and the air becomes clear.That's how the ecosystem works",,,
1188,It keeps the ecosystem safe,,,
1189,That's how the ecosystem works,,,
1190,I don't know,,,
1191,Because it has to be food for consumers,,,
1192,Because it's the food for consumers,,,
1193,I don't know.,,,
1194,"This is because without producers, consumer land and decomposers also do not survive.",,,
1195,"Without it, the ecosystem would disappear",,,
1196,There's air,,,
1197,"Without producers, primary consumers have nothing to eat, primary consumers have nothing to eat, and secondary consumers who eat primary consumers have nothing to eat, so if they disappear, the ecosystem's balance will continue to collapse.",,,
1198,It's because there needs to be food for various creatures,,,
1199,"Because there are no producers, there are no consumers",,,
1200,It clears the air and keeps the animals alive,,,
1201,This is because animals can eat grass and tree leaves.,,,
1202,for the survival of consumers,,,
1203,Because they separate the bodies,,,
1204,It's because we need to produce to consume,,,
