5,Because it makes your heart beat,,,
6,I don't know.,,,
7,yes,,,
8,Because our body's blood circulates,,,

23,This is because it can help blood reach the brain by making the heart run.,,,
24,"Gas exchange occurs through blood circulation and oxygen is supplied to the whole body. This process cannot be carried out smoothly, which can lead to brain damage. Therefore, CPR, which facilitates blood circulation, can prevent brain damage.",,,
25,"I know that brain damage is caused by blood not entering the brain. The heart beats and transmits blood to the brain, which occurs because when the heart stops, blood is not supplied to the brain. It is important because I know that CPR puts pressure on the heart that slowly stops and makes it beat again.",,,
26,"The direction of blood goes from the heart to the brain through the lungs, and if oxygen is injected into the lungs, fresh air flows into the brain, so blood circulation is smooth.",,,
27,"Blood circulation flows up and down from the heart, but when the heart stops, blood is not transferred to the brain",,,
28,"Our body needs to supply blood to the whole body around the heart, but heart attack is a disease caused by not smoothly supplying blood to the whole body, so CPR can prevent brain damage because air enters the body from the outside.",,,
29,"If you let the heart beat, the blood circulates through the body",,,
30,This is because the brain is also activated when the heart is activated.,,,
31,"Pressing the chest also connects the head to the compressed area, which can prevent brain damage",,,
32,"Lack of oxygen is highly likely to cause brain damage, but CPR allows them to breathe.",,,
33,This is because it is golden time before brain damage. It was because they supplied oxygen.,,,

72,"If the heart stops and the brain is not oxygenated, there may be brain damage. However, taking emergency measures such as CPR can prevent serious brain damage because it provides oxygen and circulates blood.",,,
73,"If you continue to send blood through simpesosynthesis, it keeps the blood flow in the brain, so it prevents such an unheard-of stroke",,,
74,This is because compressing the heart causes blood circulation and prevents brain arrest.,,,

857,It circulates the blood in place of the heart,,,
858,Oxygen needs to be transferred to the brain.,,,
859,"The reason for performing CPR is to be performed on patients who no longer have a pulse due to problems with their heart and lung function. In the case of patients who need CPR, pulse and blood pressure drop, and blood does not circulate throughout the body. If blood cannot circulate throughout the body, blood cannot be supplied to the brain, and oxygen required for cell activity cannot be supplied. If CPR is performed, brain damage can be prevented by directly circulating blood.",,,
860,To supply blood to the brain,,,
861,"By pressing the heart, you can make blood flow all over your body like when the heart beats",,,
862,"When a heart attack occurs, the heart stops and oxygen is not supplied to the brain. At this time, if the chest is compressed and blood is sent, oxygen is supplied to the brain, which can save the cardiac arrest patient.",,,
863,"Our heart is a pump that supplies blood. Therefore, heart attack patients whose hearts have stopped cannot supply blood to the body alone. Therefore, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is necessary to supply blood to the whole body and maintain body temperature.",,,
864,e,,,
865,This is because cardiopulmonary resuscitation causes blood circulation around the heart to circulate.,,,
866,My face turns red because I'm excited and my head is bleeding,,,
867,This is because blood is supplied to the brain through CPR.,,,
868,This is because it can supply blood to the whole body by making the heart beat.,,,
869,"Blood is supplied from the heart, and when a heart attack occurs, the heart stops working. At this time, compressing the heart through cardiopulmonary resuscitation can prevent brain damage by supplying blood to the brain.",,,
870,"Since blood is supplied to the whole body, CPR can prevent brain damage.",,,
871,It pumps the stopped blood and sends it to the brain,,,
