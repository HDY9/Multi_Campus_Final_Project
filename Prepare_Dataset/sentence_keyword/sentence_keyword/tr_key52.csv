In other words, in the case of bakeries belonging to one of the three main economic players, increasing the quality of their bread can persuade consumers who want to get the goods from their hard-earned money to get the goods to consumers, so they try to lower the price as much as possible and increase the quality. Therefore, for bakeries, this competition contributes to improving the quality of their products.",
