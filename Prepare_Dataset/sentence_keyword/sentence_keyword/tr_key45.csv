68,Because of the sea?,,,
69,"When the temperature difference between the water and the sandy beach occurs, the air on one side rises or falls, resulting in a difference in air pressure, causing the wind to blow",,,
70,There is a difference in temperature because the specific heat of the land and the sea is different. This creates a pressure difference and creates wind.,,,
71,This is because the temperature difference between the surrounding air occurs due to the difference in specific heat between land and sea.,,,
72,"The specific heat of the land is smaller, so it heats up quickly, resulting in a difference in air pressure.",,,
73,the difference in heat capacity between seawater and land,,,
74,This is because the difference in temperature between the ocean and the land creates a difference in atmospheric pressure.,,,
75,the difference in specific heat between the ocean and the land,,,
76,"Air expands due to uneven heating, resulting in a pressure difference. This causes air to move.",,,
77,due to the difference in air pressure,,,
78,"When the ambient air temperature is low, the air pressure decreases and the wind blows.",,,
79,"This is because the specific heat of the land is greater than the specific heat of the sea, and as the air on the land becomes hot quickly, the hot air on the land side rises, and the air on the sea moves to the empty space.",,,
80,"This is because of the difference in specific heat between sandy beaches and seawater. Sea water is heated slowly and cooled slowly due to its high specific heat. The sandy beach has a low specific heat, so it heats up quickly and cools down quickly. This difference in temperature creates wind on the beach.",,,
81,The reason why wind occurs on the beach is because of the convection of air due to the difference in density of air due to the temperature difference due to the difference in specific heat between the sea and the land.,,,
82,"The temperature of the sea rises slowly because the specific heat is large even under solar heat, but the sea is relatively lower during the day than on the land because the specific heat is relatively large when the land is subjected to tangyang heat. However, wind creates wind when there is a temperature difference, so wind occurs at the beach.",,,
83,"Sand has a smaller specific heat than water, so it is relatively smaller than water. Therefore, during the day, the sand gets hotter than water due to sunlight, so the air on the sand rises and the air on the water moves there At night, the water temperature is higher than sand, so the water temperature rises and the air on the sand moves there",,,
84,"Because the specific heat of the sea is larger than the sandy beach, the temperature of the sandy beach is larger than that of the sea during the day, and the air from the sandy beach rises from the sea to the land at night, and the air from the sandy beach flows into the empty spot.",,,
85,"On the hot side, the air becomes hot and on the relatively cold side, the hot air rises due to low density and the cold air descends due to high density, so the air is windy because convection occurs.",,,
86,"The sandy beach with low specific heat heats up faster during the day than the sea, thereby increasing the temperature of the gases on the sandy beach, lowering the density, and increasing the gas. On the other hand, the sea with high specific heat heats up slowly during the day than the sandy beach, and accordingly, the gases on the sea remain relatively low. Gas particles rising from the land side move above the sea with low air pressure, and gas particles falling from the sea side move below the land with low air pressure, and wind blows from the sea.",,,
87,It is a gate with a different scale of land and sea.,,,
88,"Land and sea have different specific heat, resulting in temperature differences. When air at a relatively higher temperature rises due to convection and the air pressure decreases, the air moves from a higher atmospheric pressure and blows wind.",,,
89,"The specific heat of water and sand is different, so the temperature between the sea and the land is different. Sand has a small specific heat, so the temperature is high during the day and the temperature is low at night. Water has a higher specific heat than sand, so the temperature is lower than that of sand during the day and higher than that of sand at night. Therefore, relative high and low pressures create wind to fill the empty space.",,,
90,"During the day, the air on the sandy beach heats up quickly due to sunlight, but the air on the sea side heats up slowly. Therefore, the sandy beach is relatively hotter. Hot air has the property of going up, so the air on the sandy beach goes up. And the air is windy toward the sea because it tries to move from hot to cold. On the contrary, the temperature of the sandy beach at night quickly drops, and the temperature of the sea slowly drops, so the temperature is relatively high on the sea side. As I said earlier, hot air has the property of trying to go up, so the air on the sea side goes up. In addition, the air flows from hot to cold, so the air rising above the sea blows toward the land.",,,
91,Because of the difference in specific heat,,,
92,"Even if the sand and the sea receive the same amount of sunlight, the temperature rises and falls at different speeds. As a result, air on the relatively high temperature rises above and air on the relatively low temperature moves to fill the spot, resulting in wind on the beach.",,,
93,"This is because when receiving the same amount of heat for the same time, the increasing temperature changes are different from the land and the sea. During the day, temperatures easily increase on land, and the temperature of the sea increases relatively slowly. The heated land heats the air above the surface, which rises and fills the blanks with air above the sea. On the other hand, at night, the land gets cold easily, and the sea is relatively warm, so the air on the sea rises and the air on the land fills the space.",,,
94,"When the temperature of the air decreases, the air tries to descend, and when the temperature of the air increases, the air tries to rise. Based on this, during daytime on the beach, the temperature of the sea is not higher than that of the land, so the air pressure on the land is lowered and the air pressure on the sea is increased. Accordingly, the air moves to the land where the air pressure is lowered and the wind blows. On the contrary to day, night is the opposite.",,,
95,"The sea is bordered by land and the sea. The sea has a large specific heat and the land has a small specific heat. In other words, when the same heat is applied, the land has a greater temperature change than the sea. Therefore, during the day, the air pressure on the land is higher than that of the sea, and the air pressure on the sea is relatively lower than that of the land, so the air pressure difference occurs and the wind blows. In addition, at night, the temperature of the land is lower than that of the sea, so the air pressure is higher than that of the land, and the air pressure is lower, so there is a difference in air pressure, which causes wind.",,,
96,"Due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature difference between the sandy beach and the seawater occurs during the day and night, resulting in a difference in air pressure between the sandy beach and the seawater, resulting in wind.",,,
97,"Because of the difference in specific heat between the sea and the land, there is a time difference in the rise or fall of the air, so air moves to fill the air where the air is scarce, creating wind.",,,
98,"This is because the temperature varies from place to place. In places with high temperatures, air rises upward and becomes relatively low pressure, and air moves around and winds blow.The sand part is hotter during the day and the sea part is hotter at night, and this temperature difference raises the air in the hot part, which lowers the air pressure below, causing the wind to blow from the cold side. This is why wind is created.",,,
99,"Gas tends to rise when the temperature is high, and to fall when the temperature is low. During the day, the sand beach is relatively warmer than the beach, so the gas rises upward. On the contrary, the gas descends on the beach. However, since the gas on the sandy beach has risen upward, there is no choice but to create an empty space. By the way, there is a descending gas on the beach. Therefore, wind is generated as the gas on the beach fills the empty space on the sandy beach.",,,

126,"During the day, the temperature of the sandy beach is high, resulting in an upward airflow, creating a low pressure, and the sea creates a downward airflow, forming a high pressure.

741,This is because the specific heat of the land is smaller than that of the sea.,,,
742,"The specific heat of the sea is greater than the specific heat of the land, so it takes a lot of time for the temperature to rise and fall. Therefore, during the day, the temperature of the sea rises later than the temperature of the land, and the air above the sea is lower than that of the air above the land.  Air on land increases in volume as the temperature increases, decreases in density, and rises, and air on the sea blows from the sea toward the land as it enters to fill the empty space as the air on the land rises. At night, the temperature of the sea, which has a large specific heat, cools relatively slowly, which is higher than the temperature of the land that cools rapidly. Then, the temperature on the sea decreases and rises, and the air on the land enters the empty space as the air on the sea rises, causing a ""sea wind"" from land to sea.",,,
743,"The sea takes a long time to heat up and takes a long time to cool down. On the other hand, land receives heat more easily and loses heat more easily than the sea.

847,"Sand beaches and water have different specific heat, which is the amount of heat required to raise 1g of substance by 1 degree Celsius. The water has a higher specific heat than the sandy beach, which means that the amount of heat required to raise the water by one degree is greater than the amount of heat required to raise the sandy beach by one degree. In short, even if water and sand are heated in the same amount of heat, water is heated slower than sand. And in other words, if water and sand are heated to the same temperature, water cools slower than sand. So the sandy beach is hotter than the sea water during the day and the sandy beach is colder than the sea at night. The reason for the wind is because of the difference in air pressure, and the air in the hot place is about to rise, but when the air rises, there is space and air enters from the relatively cold surroundings to fill it. This condition is called high pressure. And the opposite situation is called low pressure. Therefore, the air blows from low pressure to high pressure. If high pressure occurs in hot places and low pressure occurs in cold places, wind moves from the relatively cold sea to the relatively hot land during the day, and air moves from the relatively cold sea to the relatively hot sea during the day.",,,
