,"6. When Hyewon visited the botanical garden, she saw that she was an insectivorous plant that feeds on small insects. Especially, what Hyewon thought was fascinating was the Paris prison. It is said that the flytrap attracts insects with its smell, and when the insect touches the leaves, it closes the leaves to decompose the insects and absorbs nutrients. Hye-won, who read the notice board, has a question. Why are flies in the botanical garden that feed on insects that are animals? Why on earth did the doctors at the botanical garden classify Paris as a plant?",q61_Photosynthesis ,q61_Motoricity

705,"Although Parisian jade is right to eat insects. But basically, in order to be classified as an animal, you have to have animal conditions, but isn't Parisian jade classified as a plant because it meets the conditions of the plant more than the conditions of the animal?

711,"Parisian jade can be classified as a plant in that it is a dicotyledonous plant. Parisian jade can also synthesize organic matter through photosynthesis by itself. However, the reason why insects are decomposed and eaten is because the environment in which they live cannot obtain sufficient nutrients through photosynthesis alone, so they obtain nutrients through insects.",,
712,"The characteristic of plants is that they get nutrients and produce nutrients and live through them.Because insectivorous plants are also plants, they generate nutrients through the ground or sunlight, but the amount of nutrients obtained through this is insufficient, so they are supplemented by catching and eating insects.In other words, part of the process of obtaining nutrients is eaten, and in the basic part, nothing is different from any other plant.",,
713,"The big difference between plants and animals is whether they can't move on their own. Parisian hell feeds on small insects but cannot move alone. And the fly jade is called a plant because it has the structure of plants such as roots, stems, and leaves",,

There are three pairs of sensory hairs, and when the insect touches any of them twice, both sides of the leaf suddenly close, and the acid and digestive fluid are secreted from the inner line to decompose and absorb the insect.
