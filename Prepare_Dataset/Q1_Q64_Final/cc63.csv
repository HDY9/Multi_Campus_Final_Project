838,838,"When CPR is performed, blood is supplied again to prevent damage to our organs.""",,
839,839,"Since brain damage occurs because blood does not circulate, if blood is circulated by hand using CPR, it can be reduced even if it does not prevent brain damage at all.",,

854,854,"Instead of the function of the heart, it sends blood to the brain to help blood circulation",,
855,855,"Since the heart, which is important for the blood circulation of the body, has stopped, if oxygen does not go to the brain, it will cause brain damage. Press the heart with your hands to pump it so that blood can circulate artificially.",,

859,859,"The reason for performing CPR is to be performed on patients who no longer have a pulse due to problems with their heart and lung function. In the case of patients who need CPR, pulse and blood pressure drop, and blood does not circulate throughout the body. If blood cannot circulate throughout the body, blood cannot be supplied to the brain, and oxygen required for cell activity cannot be supplied. If CPR is performed, brain damage can be prevented by directly circulating blood.",,
