857,857,The conch in a strong place is an insider,,
858,858,This is because conch lived in different environments and evolved to suit the environment.,,
859,859,This is because conch in places with strong currents evolved to develop horns to avoid being washed away by water.,,
860,860,"This is because the water flows between the horns, weakening the power of the current",,
861,861,This is because conch in places where the current is weak does not have to withstand the pressure of water.,,
