Tansley, who argued that 'to recognize the state of nature as it is, we must integrate the biological and inorganic environments in which it relates.' However, the concept of ecosystems that living things and the environment surrounding them are closely related to each other has existed since before. This concept was developed by Clementz around 1930 and proposed the concept of biome, which sees life and the environment as a kind of organism. Here, Tansley came to propose the concept of an 'ecosystem' in which biomes and a broad sense of inanimate environment interact with each other. Later, the concept of ecology and ecology was established and developed by Raymond Laurel Lindeman, Eugene Pleasants Odum, and Gordon L. Clark.",1057.0,"1093,1,1,0,,,"

In addition, things such as arable and urban ecosystems can be considered. In addition, it is divided into producers (green plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria or microorganisms) around the function of living things.
