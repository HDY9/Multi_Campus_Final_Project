1279,1279,Put it in hot water,1279.0,"1323,1,1,,"
1280,1280,This is because the heat was fine on the metal ladle as the water boiled.,1280.0,"1324,1,0,,"
1281,1281,It is because the hot heat gradually rises to the metal,1281.0,"1325,1,0,,"
1282,1282,Metal moves quickly by heat,1282.0,"1326,0,1,,"
1283,1283,Because of the heat,1283.0,"1327,1,1,,"

1302,1302,This is because metal is more heat transferable than wood,,
1303,1303,Because the heat is transferred with a ladle,,
1304,1304,This is because a metal ladle has higher thermal conductivity than a wooden ladle.,,
1305,1305,This is because the heat conduction is large.,,
1306,1306,It's because the heat was transferred,,
1307,1307,"Because the water receives heat energy and the heat energy convections in the water, and the energy is transferred to the metal ladle",,
1308,1308,This is because the heat has moved from hot to cold.,,
