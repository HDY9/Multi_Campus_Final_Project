Therefore, during daytime, the light emitted by the sun is very large, so the light emitted by the stars appears relatively small. In days when the sun's light is weak due to clouds or at times when the sun sets, the star is visible, indicating that it is related to the amount of sunlight.

549,549,"Although stars are floating during the day, stars are not stars that emit light themselves, but reflect or absorb light from the surrounding light, so the intensity of light is weaker than that of the Sun, a star. In other words, stars with relatively weak light intensity are invisible during the day because solar radiation energy enters the Earth's surface during daytime.",549.0,"567,1,"

552,552,"Other stars have the same brightness as the sun, so they will have similar or larger absolute ratings. However, other stars are very far from the Earth compared to the Sun.

Therefore, because starlight outside the sun is relatively very dark, our eyes can only see the light emitted from the sun.",552.0,"571,1,"
553,553,"Daytime is due to the fact that the sun illuminates the area, which is located on the horizon when viewed from Earth.

1097,1097,"As the Earth rotates, the surface of the earth we are on during the day faces the sun, so we can see the sun. The reason why stars cannot be seen at this time is that the light of the sun we see is brighter than the light of stars. Of course, the light of other stars can be bright, but the sun looks brighter because it is close to Earth.",1097.0,"1134,1,"

However, even stars of the same brightness look different depending on the distance, which is called apparent grade. It is said that the smaller the apparent grade, the brighter it is. However, because the sun is much brighter than other stars, these ratings are ignored and stars are not visible only during the daytime when the sun is active.",1099.0,"1136,1,"

If the light around it becomes brighter than the light emitted by the star, we cannot see the star. During the day, the light from the sun is brighter than the light that the star can make, so we cannot see the star because it is covered by the light. However, it is dark at night after sunset, so we can see the stars easily.

For example, the glow of a glow-in-the-dark sticker is only visible when the light is turned off and not visible when turned on. However, this is because the glow of the light is brighter than the glow of the light, not the glow of the light goes out.
