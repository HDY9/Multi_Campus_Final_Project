Buoyancy is the force to push an object upward as much as the pressure difference in the direction of gravity on the upper and lower surfaces of a specific object submerged in a fluid. Due to this pressure difference, the object stops at a height at which the force to push upward is equal to the weight of the object. For this reason, a locked object sinks when it is denser than a liquid.

709,709,"This is closely related to buoyancy. An object submerged in a fluid, such as water or air, receives a force from the fluid in an upward direction opposite to gravity, which is called buoyancy. Usually, if the difference between the water pressure that an object receives from the bottom and the water pressure from the top is greater than the gravity that the water bottle receives, the water bottle floats above the water. In the case of a ship, it is not subjected to water pressure from the top, but only from the bottom. If this water pressure is greater than the gravity the ship receives, the ship floats. Therefore, if you add water, the boat floats, so that the boat can move along the flow of water.",709.0,"733,1,0"
