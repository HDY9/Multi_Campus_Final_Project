80,80,"This is because of the difference in specific heat between sandy beaches and seawater. Sea water is heated slowly and cooled slowly due to its high specific heat.

This difference in temperature creates wind on the beach.",80.0,"82,0,1,1, because of the temperature difference between land and sea,"

82,82,"The temperature of the sea rises slowly because the specific heat is large even under solar heat, but the sea is relatively lower during the day than on the land because the specific heat is relatively large when the land is subjected to tangyang heat.

83,83,"Sand has a smaller specific heat than water, so it is relatively smaller than water.

84,84,"Because the specific heat of the sea is larger than the sandy beach, the temperature of the sandy beach is larger than that of the sea during the day, and the air from the sandy beach rises from the sea to the land at night, and the air from the sandy beach flows into the empty spot.",84.0,"86,1,1,1, the cold air goes down and the warm air goes up"

On the other hand, the sea with high specific heat heats up slowly during the day than the sandy beach, and accordingly, the gases on the sea remain relatively low. Gas particles rising from the land side move above the sea with low air pressure, and gas particles falling from the sea side move below the land with low air pressure, and wind blows from the sea.",86.0,"88,1,1,1, the cold air moves downward and the warm air moves upward to create a wind89,0,1,1, the cold air moves down and the warm air moves up to create a wind,"

89,89,"The specific heat of water and sand is different, so the temperature between the sea and the land is different. Sand has a small specific heat, so the temperature is high during the day and the temperature is low at night. Water has a higher specific heat than sand, so the temperature is lower than that of sand during the day and higher than that of sand at night. Therefore, relative high and low pressures create wind to fill the empty space.",89.0,"92,1,0, the cold air moves down, the warm air moves up, and the wind is created"
90,90,"During the day, the air on the sandy beach heats up quickly due to sunlight, but the air on the sea side heats up slowly. Therefore, the sandy beach is relatively hotter. Hot air has the property of going up, so the air on the sandy beach goes up. And the air is windy toward the sea because it tries to move from hot to cold. On the contrary, the temperature of the sandy beach at night quickly drops, and the temperature of the sea slowly drops, so the temperature is relatively high on the sea side. As I said earlier, hot air has the property of trying to go up, so the air on the sea side goes up. In addition, the air flows from hot to cold, so the air rising above the sea blows toward the land.",90.0,"93,1,1,0 , the cold air moves down and the warm air moves up to make wind,"

93,93,"This is because when receiving the same amount of heat for the same time, the increasing temperature changes are different from the land and the sea. During the day, temperatures easily increase on land, and the temperature of the sea increases relatively slowly. The heated land heats the air above the surface, which rises and fills the blanks with air above the sea. On the other hand, at night, the land gets cold easily, and the sea is relatively warm, so the air on the sea rises and the air on the land fills the space.",93.0,"96,1,1, the cold air and warm air move to create wind,"
94,94,"When the temperature of the air decreases, the air tries to descend, and when the temperature of the air increases, the air tries to rise. Based on this, during daytime on the beach, the temperature of the sea is not higher than that of the land, so the air pressure on the land is lowered and the air pressure on the sea is increased. Accordingly, the air moves to the land where the air pressure is lowered and the wind blows. On the contrary to day, night is the opposite.",94.0,"97,1,0,1, the cold air and warm air move to create wind,"
95,95,"The sea is bordered by land and the sea. The sea has a large specific heat and the land has a small specific heat. In other words, when the same heat is applied, the land has a greater temperature change than the sea. Therefore, during the day, the air pressure on the land is higher than that of the sea, and the air pressure on the sea is relatively lower than that of the land, so the air pressure difference occurs and the wind blows. In addition, at night, the temperature of the land is lower than that of the sea, so the air pressure is higher than that of the land, and the air pressure is lower, so there is a difference in air pressure, which causes wind.",95.0,"98,0,0,0...

98,98,"This is because the temperature varies from place to place. In places with high temperatures, air rises upward and becomes relatively low pressure, and air moves around and winds blow.The sand part is hotter during the day and the sea part is hotter at night, and this temperature difference raises the air in the hot part, which lowers the air pressure below, causing the wind to blow from the cold side. This is why wind is created.",98.0,"Because there is a difference in temperature of 101,1,1,1,"
99,99,"Gas tends to rise when the temperature is high, and to fall when the temperature is low. During the day, the sand beach is relatively warmer than the beach, so the gas rises upward.
