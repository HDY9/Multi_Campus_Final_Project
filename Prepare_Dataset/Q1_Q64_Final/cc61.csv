,Unnamed: 0,"6. When Hyewon visited the botanical garden, she saw that she was an insectivorous plant that feeds on small insects. Especially, what Hyewon thought was fascinating was the Paris prison. It is said that the flytrap attracts insects with its smell, and when the insect touches the leaves, it closes the leaves to decompose the insects and absorbs nutrients. Hye-won, who read the notice board, has a question. Why are flies in the botanical garden that feed on insects that are animals? Why on earth did the doctors at the botanical garden classify Paris as a plant?",Unnamed: 0,", q61_photosynthesis, q61_motility"

Four to eight leaves sprout from the root, are 3 to 12 cm long, and have wide wings on the stem. The leaves are round and the ends are narrow, and long hairs like thorns are formed on the edges. Both sides are closed around the main vein and merge well like a clam.",,
847,847,"There are many lines on the leaves that attract insects. There are three pairs of sensory hairs, and when the insect touches any of them twice, both sides of the leaf suddenly close, and the acid and digestive fluid are secreted from the inner line to decompose and absorb the insect. Flowers bloom white in June, with about 10 flowers hanging at the end of the stem.",,
848,848,"As an insectivorous plant, it is grown for ornamental purposes or teaching materials, and water moss is planted in a pot and is always wet.
