10,10,Beutane in a gaseous state is stored in a liquid state with low reactivity because it has high reactivity.,10,,,,,,,,
11,11,"At the same amount, the volume of the gas is larger than the volume of the liquid, so it must be stored as a liquid to store it in less space.",11,,,,,,,,
12,12,"Since it is stored in a high pressure state, a combustible gas such as butane gas can be used relatively safely.",12,,,,,,,,

22,22,I doubt it.,22,,,,,,,,
23,23,It is easy to store and can contain more liquid. (The volume of the liquid is smaller than the volume of the gas.) You can see how much is left by shaking the butane gas.,23,,,,,,,,
24,24,"Since the gas is denser than the liquid, storing the gas in a liquid state can store a relatively larger amount.",24,,,,,,,,
25,25,This is because the volume occupied when a substance exists as a liquid is smaller than when it exists as a gas.,25,,,,,,,,

853,853,Gas is bulky and difficult to store.,853,,,,,,,,
854,854,"It exists in a liquid state under high pressure, but it is converted into gas because the pressure decreases while leaving butane gas.",854,,,,,,,,
855,855,Gas is bulky and difficult to store.,855,,,,,,,,
856,856,"Since the volume of the gas is larger than the volume of the liquid, when stored as a liquid, a larger amount can be stored.",856,,,,,,,,
857,857,It's easy to store,857,,,,,,,,
858,858,I don't know.,858,,,,,,,,
859,859,This is because the volume of the gas in the same space is larger than the liquid.,859,,,,,,,,
860,860,This is because there is a risk of bursting if stored in a gas.,860,,,,,,,,
861,861,"""",861,,,,,,,,
862,862,"Gas is extremely large in volume than liquid or solid, so it is inefficient to put it in a container in a gaseous state and store it in a liquid state.",862,,,,,,,,
863,863,"Gas is in a state where the distance between molecules is very far apart, and liquid is arranged irregularly, and the density of liquid is much higher than that of the gas. Therefore, if butane gas is stored in a liquid state at high pressure, it is easy to carry around, so it is stored in a liquid state.",863,,,,,,,,
864,864,"Because gases are larger in volume than liquids, they are stored in a liquid state to hold more fuel in a limited volume of butane gas cylinders.",864,,,,,,,,
865,865,"Because gases are larger in volume than liquids, they are stored in a liquid state to hold more fuel in a limited volume of butane gas cylinders.",865,,,,,,,,
866,866,Gas is stored in a liquid state with a small volume change because it is not suitable for storage due to its large volume and large volume change depending on temperature.,866,,,,,,,,
867,867,"This is because it is more disadvantageous than liquid storage to determine whether it has leaked or how much remains are left. This is because the liquid phase has a greater intermolecular attraction than the gaseous phase, so it exists in a visible state.",867,,,,,,,,
868,868,"The liquid is smaller in volume than the gas, so it is easy to carry around.",868,,,,,,,,

872,872,The reason for storing gas-based substances in a liquid state is that it is better to store them in a liquid because the mass of the same volume of gas and liquid is higher.,872,,,,,,,,
873,873,"In the case of gas, the bond between particles is unstable, the particle is small, so there is a high possibility of leakage, and it is difficult to store the gas due to its large volume.",873,,,,,,,,
874,874,for stabilization,874,,,,,,,,
875,875,"Most substances, except water, have larger volumes in the order of solid, liquid, and gas depending on their condition. The volume difference between the liquid and the gas is very large, and for this reason, storing more butane gas fuel in a liquid can be efficiently stored than storing it in a gas.",875,,,,,,,,

877,877,I don't know,877,,,,,,,,
878,878,"Since the liquid is lighter in volume than the gas,",878,,,,,,,,
879,879,"Since the liquid state is smaller in volume than in the gaseous state, it can be stored efficiently. That's why it's stored in a liquid state.",879,,,,,,,,
880,880,"In the case of gases, it is difficult to contain the desired capacity in a certain container because in the case of gases, the space between particles is very far, so the use of materials must be very large to store them in a gaseous state. Therefore, it is stored in a liquid state where the space between the particles is relatively close. Since the material stored in this way is in an unstable state, it can be converted into a gas when an impact is applied, so it can be used in the form of a gas.",880,,,,,,,,
881,881,"It puts a lot of pressure in the butane gas to convert the butane of the gas into liquid. When the gas becomes a liquid, the gap between particles becomes extremely narrow, and butane in a state of high density and small volume can be obtained. This is a great utility in our lives.",881,,,,,,,,
882,882,"When a gaseous substance is converted into a liquid state, the volume of the substance decreases. Therefore, storing the material in a liquid state can store a larger amount of material than storing the material in a gaseous state in a small container.",882,,,,,,,,
883,883,"A certain amount can be put in a fixed volume, and even if it is the same amount, it is efficient because the volume is small when stored as a liquid.",883,,,,,,,,

885,885,"To minimize the volume,",885,,,,,,,,

887,887,Gas is larger and more stable than liquid.,887,,,,,,,,
888,888,"The gaseous state occupies more volume than the liquid state, and when stored in a gaseous state, the volume expands due to heat and the risk of bursting is high, so it is kept in a liquid state.",888,,,,,,,,
889,889,Because the atoms are more stable than the gases,,,,,,,,,
