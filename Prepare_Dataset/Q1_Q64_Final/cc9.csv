When relatively warm air stays on the cold ground or on the surface of the water, the air on the contact surface is cooled by contact. At this time, when it reaches saturation, fog or stratified clouds may occur. On the other hand, when air rises without heat exchange with the surroundings, it is insulated and expanded to cool the rising air as it works outside. The most common method of cooling air can be said to be cooling by rising. Clouds are created as the air rises to reach saturation by adiabatic cooling and the water vapor condenses. """,788,,,,,,,,,
789,789,"When air cools in the atmosphere, it easily leads to saturation. There are three ways to cool the air: contact, mixing, and rising.
