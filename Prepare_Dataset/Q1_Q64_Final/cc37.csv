82,82,"As the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the snack rise, the atmospheric pressure decreases, and the pressure pushed outside the snack bag decreases, but the pressure inside the snack bag swells because it is the same.",82.0,"84,1,1,1,0, the bag of snacks swells when the pressure is lowered in the high mountains,"
83,83,"High mountains have low density of air due to weak gravity. Therefore, in the mountains, the air pressure becomes relatively smaller, so the air pressure in the bag of snacks becomes relatively large and becomes larger in volume",83.0,"85,1,0,0, the bag swells when the pressure is lowered in the high mountains"
84,84,"As the height increases from the ground, the magnitude of the gravity received by the air decreases, which lowers the air pressure and lowers the external air pressure, causing the air pressure in the bag to become larger than the air pressure of the outside air, so the bag swells.",84.0,"86,0,1,1,0, when the pressure decreases in the high mountains, the volume increases"

97,97,"When you go up to a high place, the air becomes thin and the air pressure is lowered. When the air pressure decreases, the pressure to press the snack bag also decreases, causing the snack bag to swell.",97.0,"100,1,0,1,0, high mountains, when the pressure decreases, the bag of snacks swells up,"
98,98,"High places have low air pressure because the air tries to stay low due to gravity. Therefore, since the air in the snack made at an ordinary height is lower than the air pressure in the high mountain, the volume of the air in the bag increases and the air pressure in the bag increases to become equal to the air outside.As the height increases from the ground, the distribution of air becomes thinner. When the air becomes thinner, the number of air molecules around it decreases. This means that the air pressure created by the collision of air molecules decreases. Therefore, the air pressure above the mountain is lower than the air pressure on the ground. Therefore, as the science bag, which existed in a state similar to the pressure of the ground, rises to a high mountain, the ambient air pressure decreases, and the pressure of the snack bag rises relatively high.",98.0,"101,1,0,0, the bag swells when the pressure decreases in the high mountains,"
99,99,"I know that the higher you go, the lower the air pressure. So if we compare the air pressure in the low places where we usually live with the air pressure in the high mountains, the air pressure in our living quarters will be higher than the air pressure in the high mountains. When we climb a high mountain with a bag of snacks, the air pressure moves from relatively high to low. Therefore, it means that the pressure applied to nitrogen in the bag of snacks gradually decreases, so the bag of snacks swells.",99.0,"102,1,1,1,0, the volume increases when the pressure decreases in the high mountains"
100,100,by the pressure difference,100.0,"103,1,1,1,0, the volume increases when the pressure decreases in the high mountains"
