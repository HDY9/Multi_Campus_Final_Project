Just as we cannot live without water, plants cannot live without water. Sucking such important water from the ground into the body of a plant is called the ""absorption"" of the root. The principle that the roots absorb water can be explained by osmotic pressure. Almost all of the membranes that make up the plant are semi-permeable membranes. When plants absorb water from their roots, comparing root hairs and water in the soil, the water in the soil is low and the root hairs are relatively high. In order to achieve concentration equilibrium, low concentration of moisture in the soil permeates into the high concentration of root hairs through the cell membrane.

916,916,Plants grow by absorbing moisture and nutrients in the ground.,,,,,,,
917,917,The roots of the plants support the plants on the ground so that they do not fall down and absorb moisture in the soil.,,,,,,,
918,918,The roots have a very large surface area. It absorbs a large amount of water and conversely releases minerals such as potassium and sodium. It also uses bacteria from beans and plants to fix nitrogen needed for plant growth.,,,,,,,
919,919,The roots of the plant are responsible for supporting the plant to be fixed to the ground and for absorbing water and inorganic nutrients.,,,,,,,
920,920,The roots of the plant are responsible for supporting the plant to be fixed to the ground and for absorbing water and inorganic nutrients.,,,,,,,
921,921,"It supports plants, absorbs water and nutrients, and stores nutrients.",,,,,,,
922,922,"It supports plants from below to prevent them from falling down. And it absorbs water from the soil and transports it to stems, leaves, and flowers.",,,,,,,
923,923,Roots work in support and nutrient absorption.,,,,,,,
924,924,Plant roots function to absorb nutrients and water from the ground.,,,,,,,
925,925,The roots have the function of delivering nutrients and moisture from the ground well upward.,,,,,,,

927,927,The plant's roots support the plant and also absorb moisture.,,,,,,,
928,928,"The stage of plant composition consists of cells, tissues, tissues, organs, and individuals, and the roots correspond to the nutritional organs. In the roots, nutrients and water are absorbed through osmotic pressure, which moves to other tissues through the body and water pipes.",,,,,,,
929,929,It absorbs nutrients and water,,,,,,,
930,930,"The roots of the plant dig deep into the ground and support the stems and branches, and the root hairs on the roots absorb the surrounding water and nutrients. Some species also store nutrients in their roots.",,,,,,,
