There are two reasons why the fire goes out after spraying water. First, water interferes with the binding of de-materials and oxygen, so that the fire is extinguished. Spraying water is like trapping a de-material in water, which prevents it from reacting with oxygen. The second is when the water is cold. If the water sprayed on the de-material is cold, the fire is extinguished because the water not only blocks the reaction with oxygen, but also absorbs the temperature of the de-material to lower the temperature of the de-material so that it does not meet two of the three conditions.",816.0,"809, pertaining to the excretory system, 0, 0, 1, 0"
