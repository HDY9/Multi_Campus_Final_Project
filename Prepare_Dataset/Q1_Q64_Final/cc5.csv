942,942,The liquid vaporizes and absorbs heat,,,,,
943,943,"Sweat is liquid. The reason why the body sweats is to lower the body temperature, but the body cools down because the sweat vaporizes and takes away the heat of vaporization.",,,,,
944,944,"The sweat evaporates and flies away from the skin's surface, and when this phenomenon occurs, heat absorption occurs that absorbs heat from the surrounding area. Therefore, lowering the body temperature is a phenomenon that occurs because the vaporization phenomenon is an endothermic reaction.",,,,,
945,945,The liquid sweat evaporates and an endothermic reaction occurs. Why do we need this heat absorption energy? It happens because it weakens the attraction between particles in a liquid state and makes them into gas states that are far from each other. So to absorb the heat from our bodies.The body temperature drops.,,,,,
946,946,Most of the sweat is made up of water. This water uses heat energy when it evaporates. The use of heat energy lowers the body temperature.,,,,,
947,947,"The sweat holes in the body become bigger, and as you sweat, the body's heat escapes and the body temperature decreases. The evaporation of sweat is the vaporization of a liquid into a gas, and it is an endothermic reaction.",,,,,

949,949,Sweat vaporizes and takes away heat from the body according to the change in the condition of the substance,,,,,
950,950,"Sweat is a liquid, but as the liquid vaporizes, it becomes cool to carry heat together.",,,,,
951,951,"The liquid vaporizes into a gas and takes away the surrounding heat energy. Therefore, sweat and sweat vaporize, depriving the body of heat, lowering body temperature.",,,,,
952,952,"The liquid sweat evaporates into the air over time and disappears. The change of a liquid substance into a gaseous state is called vaporization. Since gaseous substances have more energy than liquid substances, liquid substances need to absorb heat from their surroundings to obtain energy to become gaseous substances. In other words, when sweat evaporates, it absorbs heat and evaporates, which lowers body temperature.",,,,,
