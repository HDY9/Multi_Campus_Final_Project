913,913,"I don't remember the details of the thermos, but it contains heat retention",,
914,914,This is because the outside of the thermos is completely sealed and the inside is well heat transferred and maintained in order to keep the temperature and temperature from cooling due to the cold air outside in warm water.,,
915,915,"Since heat escapes easily, the thermos contains insulation to prevent heat escaping, which maximizes warmth compared to ordinary water bottles.",,
916,916,This is because thermos blocks heat transfer by insulation.,,

918,918,This is because thermos has many insulation functions.,,
919,919,"Heat is transferred through conduction, but if a material with poor conduction is left, heat loss is reduced due to conduction, so heat can be maintained continuously. Using Insulation",,
920,920,"Heat is transferred through conduction, convection, and radiation, and thermos is the principle of conduction. Thermos have a space close to a vacuum in the middle, so heat transfer rarely occurs.",,

932,932,"Usually, heat transfer occurs through convection that travels through the air, or through conduction that moves directly from an object to an object, and through radiation that is transmitted in a vacuum. However, in the case of thermos, the inner wall surrounding the contents is vacuum, so it primarily prevents convection or conduction, and the outside is plated with silver to prevent secondary radiation, and prevents outside air, so the contents can be kept warm.",,

937,937,"The thermos has a gap between the inner and outer bottles, where heat stays in the space and thickens the boundary between the outside temperature and the inside temperature. Therefore, a large temperature difference does not occur, so that the temperature of the water in the inner bottle may be kept warm.",,
938,938,"The principle of the thermos is simple, but it can be considered that the two water bottles of different sizes are overlapped and then vacuumed. Then, since there is no medium, the heat movement between the object in the thermos and the outside air is extremely reduced and can be continuously preserved.",,
