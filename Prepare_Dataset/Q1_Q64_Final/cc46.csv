85,85,"During the day, the sand heats up faster than the sea, which maintains a nearly constant temperature, so hot air is created on land and cold air is created in the sea, which causes convection and wind blows toward the land.

89,89,"As described in 1), the land temperature is relatively high during the day, and the sea temperature is relatively high at night.

94,94,"During the day, the temperature of the sea air is lower than that of the land air, so when the land air rises and the pressure decreases, the sea air moves to fill the empty space. The reason is that the air from the sea moves to the land and the wind blows. Conversely, at night, the air temperature in the sea rises because it is relatively warmer than the air temperature over land. As a result, the atmospheric pressure of the sea is lowered, and air moves to fill this empty space from the land, so the wind blows over the land to the sea. This shows that the specific train difference is due to changing the direction of the wind.",94.0,"97,1,1 This is because the temperature of the land is higher during the day, because the air pressure of the sea is higher than that of the lower land"
95,95,"The beach is bordered by land and sea. The sea has a high specific heat and the land has a low specific heat. In other words, when the same heat is applied, the temperature change on land is greater than that of the sea. Therefore, during the day, the land is warmer than the sea and the air pressure is lower, and the sea is relatively colder than the land, so the air pressure rises. Here, the wind moves from the high-pressure ocean to the low-pressure land because it moves with a pressure difference. At night, the land is cooler than the sea and the air pressure rises, and the sea is relatively warmer than the land, so the air pressure is lowered. Here, the wind blows from the land to the sea because the land is high pressure and the sea is low pressure.",95.0,"98,1,1 Because the temperature of the sea and the land varies during the day and night, the low air pressure on the land is low"
96,96,"Sand has a lower specific heat compared to water, so the range of temperature change is large. Therefore, the sandy beach has a wider range of temperature changes between night and day. So, during the day, the sandy beach is warmer than the sea water, and the warm air rises. The temperature of seawater is lower than that of the sandy beach, so the cooler air compared to the sandy beach air descends downwards. Cold air from the descending seawater moves toward the sandy beach, and warm air from the rising sandy beach moves toward the seawater, creating convection of air. So during the day, the wind blows from the sea to the sandy beach. At night, the sandy beach is cooler than the seawater, and the cooler air is lowered. The seawater is warmer than the sandy beach, so the warmer air rises above the sandy beach. Cold air from the descending sandy beach moves toward the seawater, and warm air from the rising seawater moves toward the sandy beach, creating convection of air. So at night, the wind blows from the sandy beach towards the sea.",96.0,"99,1,1 This is because the temperature of the sea and land varies during the day and night, and the low air pressure on the land is low"
97,97,"The beach consists of land and sea. During the day, the air temperature rises faster on land with a low specific heat than the sea with a high specific heat, and the air pressure rises and the air pressure decreases. Air moves from the sea to the land where the air has risen a lot. At night, the sea with a high specific heat cools slowly, and the land with a low specific heat cools quickly, causing the air to drop and the air pressure to rise. . At night, air moves from land to sea and winds blow from land to sea.",97.0,"Because the temperature of the sea and land varies between 100, 1, 0, day and night, because the air pressure on the low land is low"
98,98,"This is because the specific heat of seawater and sandy beaches are different. Specific heat is the heat required to raise 1 kg of an object by 1 degree Celsius. Since the specific heat of sand is less than that of seawater, it heats up quickly and cools down quickly. Therefore, the sandy beach has a higher temperature than the sea during the day, and the air on the sandy beach side is heated up. As the temperature of the sea-side air rises, the sandy beach becomes high pressure and the sea becomes low pressure, and the wind blows from the sandy beach to the sea.During the day, the specific heat of the sand is smaller and the temperature changes better, so the land area becomes hotter and the air in the land area rises. As a result, the air pressure on the land side decreases, and the air pressure on the sea side increases relatively, and wind blows from the sea to the land. On the contrary, at night, the temperature of the sea is higher, so the air rises and winds blow from land to sea.",98.0,"101,1,0, low land air pressure is low because the temperature of the land is high during the day and the temperature of the sea is high during the night"
99,99,"As answered in No. 1, the gas rises and falls due to changes in temperature. However, due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature of sand during the day will be relatively higher than that of water, and at night, the temperature of water will be relatively lower than that of sand. Therefore, the position of where the gas rises and falls is reversed, and the direction of the wind will also blow differently.",99.0,"102,1,0, low air pressure on land is low because the temperature on land is high during the day and the temperature on the sea is high during the night"

1349,1349,The direction of the wind changes because the sea is colder than the land at night and the land is colder than the sea during the day.,,
1350,1350,"The specific heat of sand is smaller than seawater, so it heats up faster during the day, and cools faster at night, so the direction of the wind depends on the pressure difference caused by it.",,
1351,1351,The degree to which it is heated and cooled,,
1352,1352,"There is a difference in specific heat between the sea and the land, which causes a temperature difference between day and night, so the direction changes between day and night.",,
1353,1353,Because the temperature difference between the sea and the land is different day and night,,
1354,1354,I don't understand.,,
1355,1355,Temperature difference,,
1356,1356,"During the day, the sand heats up faster, and at night, the sand cools faster, so there are sea and land winds",,
1357,1357,Because the heat of the earth and the sea are different,,
1358,1358,"Because the land heats up faster and lowers faster than water, the wind blows due to the temperature difference",,
1359,1359,The temperature of the air in the land and the sea is reversed during the day and night,,
1360,1360,Because of the ebb and flow,,
1361,1361,"During the day, the air on the beach goes up, and at night, the air on the sea goes up",,
1362,1362,The temperature is different between day and night,,
1363,1363,This is because the land is relatively hot during the day and the sea is relatively hot at night.,,
1364,1364,I guess we're not on good terms,,
1365,1365,"Due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature of sand is higher than that of water during the day, but the direction of the wind is different because water with a large specific heat is higher than that of sand at night.",,
1366,1366,"Due to the difference in specific heat between sand and water, the temperature of sand is higher than that of water during the day, but water with a large specific heat at night has a higher temperature than sand, so the direction of the wind changes.",,
1367,1367,"This is because rising air currents occur on the sand during the day due to relatively hot sand and cold seawater, and rising air currents occur on the sea due to relatively cold sand and hot seawater at night.",,
1368,1368,"The temperature difference between day and night is small in the sea, but the temperature difference on land is large, so the temperature difference between day and night is different",,
1369,1369,This is because the land is lower in temperature than the sea.,,
1370,1370,The direction is always different,,
1371,1371,Because of the temperature difference,,
1372,1372,land and sea winds,,
1373,1373,This is because the land is higher than the sea during the day and the sea is higher than the land at night.,,
1374,1374,This is because sea winds blow during the day and land winds blow at night.,,
