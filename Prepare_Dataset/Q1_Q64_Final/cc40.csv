1336,1336,This is because heat conduction is poor for wooden ladles and heat conduction is good for metal ladles.,,
1337,1337,It's the same as the one on the top,,
1338,1338,Metal has a high heat transfer,,
1339,1339,Because it's a conductor,,
1340,1340,This is because metal ladles have higher thermal conductivity than wooden ladles.,,
1341,1341,This is because metal ladle has better thermal conductivity than wood.,,
