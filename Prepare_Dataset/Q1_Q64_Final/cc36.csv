Therefore, the larger these values, the greater the intensity of salt water, and the smaller the value, the smaller the intensity of salt water. The second method is to compare the amount of salt produced by adjusting the amount of water in a, b, and c beaker to the same temperature. A degree to which a solute is dissolved in the solution is proportional to the temperature and the amount of the solution, so if the amount of the solution is the same and the temperature is cooled, salt is deposited in a supersaturated state.
