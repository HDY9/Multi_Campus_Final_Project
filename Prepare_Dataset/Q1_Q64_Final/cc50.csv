547,547,"Because convex lenses refract light, they distort the image. Since convex lenses have the property of collecting light, object images observed through light are also collected.

548,548,"The plane glass does not differ much from the actual object through the plane glass because light just passes through it or refracts very little.

549,549,"In flat glass, light passes through just a straight line, but convex lenses have the property of collecting light into one place.

550,550,"Depending on the location of the object, the way it is viewed with flat glass and the way it is viewed using convex lenses varies. When an object is near, the focus is close to the lens and it seems to be enlarged compared to what is viewed as a flat glass. However, if an object is located far away, the focus will be far away from the lens, so if it is seen straight from the plane glass, it will look upside down from the convex lens.",550.0,"568,1,0569,1,0"
