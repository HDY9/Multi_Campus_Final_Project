645,645,"As an acid base reagent, the color of the acid base reagent varies depending on the pH (hydrogen ion index). The acid base reagent itself is a weak acid or weak base. If you drop one or two drops of an indicator, which is a weak acid, in an acidic solution, hydrogen attached to the indicator does not come off easily. This is because there are already many hydrogen ions in the solution. However, if a basic substance is added to the solution little by little, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution decreases, so that the hydrogen attached to the indicator is dissociated and the number of molecules present in an ionic state increases. As the acidity of the solution changes, the number of indicator molecules whose molecular structure changes increases, and the color of the molecule changes as the molecular structure changes. By observing the color that appears, you can find the approximate pH and find the neutralization point. The range of pH, which gradually changes the color of the indicator, is called the discoloration range, which varies from indicator to indicator.",645.0,"667,1,0,1,0,,,,"

849,849,"This is because if you put basic substances in an acidic substance, the acidity weakens",,
850,850,"This is because when basic substances are added to acidic substances, a neutralization reaction occurs, in which the acidity weakens.",,
851,851,Acids and bases decay by neutralization,,
852,852,"According to the Bronsted Lowry base, acids release hydrogen ions and bases release hydroxide ions. When an acid and a base meet, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions meet to create water, which causes a neutralization reaction. As a result, acidity and basicity are weakened.",,
853,853,Acid and basicity weaken because a neutralization reaction occurs when an acid meets a base.,,
854,854,Acid and basicity weaken because a neutralization reaction occurs when an acid meets a base.,,
855,855,Because acids and bases neutralize when they meet.,,
856,856,"Acid means pH less than 7 and basic means more than 7, which is the -log [H+] The more hydrogen ions, the more acidic they are, and the less hydrogen ions, the more basic they are. When acidity and basicity meet, the ions are reduced or increased in concentration of hydrogen ions through chemical reactions, which are different from their original values.",,

858,858,I don't know,,
859,859,Each property is weakened by acid base neutralization because acids and bases try to mix when they meet each other.,,
860,860,"When acidity and basicity are mixed, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions meet to form water, which lowers the concentration of hydrogen ions and increases the pH",,
861,861,"Acid is low in pH and basic is high in pH, because when the two meet, a neutralization reaction occurs.",,
862,862,"Acidic substances emit hydrogen ions, and basic substances receive hydrogen ions. When the two meet, a neutralization reaction occurs, which weakens each other's properties.",,
863,863,I don't know,,
864,864,"The H+ and OH- amounts in the solution distinguish between acids and bases and determine their strength. If the number is low based on the neutral pH 7, it is called basic if the acid is high, where pH means -log[H+], so the higher the hydrogen ions, the lower the pH value. When H+ and OH- meet, water-producing reactions occur, so when acidity and basicity are mixed, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in each solution combine with water, weakening the acidity and basicity.",,

869,869,"Acid and basicity react with each other through a neutralization reaction to create a neutral molecule called water, which weakens the acidity and basicity.",,
870,870,"If you think that acidic basicity will be divided by H+ OH-ions because it is a solution, adding an acidic solution and basic solution weakens the acidic basicity as the two ions meet to produce water.",,
871,871,"Acid has the property of releasing H+, and basic has the tongue that absorbs H+. Therefore, when basic and acidic meet, the pH changes because the concentration of H+ changes.",,
