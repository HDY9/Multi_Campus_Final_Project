,Unnamed: 0,"2. I bought a winter heating device, and I heard that it is better to install it at the bottom of the classroom, not on the wall of the classroom, to make the entire classroom warm. Let's explain in detail why it's good to install a heating device at the bottom of the classroom using our knowledge of the movement of heat in the gas.

27,27,"This is due to convection. Basically, warm liquid-gas has the property of going up and cold liquid-gas has the property of going down. When a heating device is installed at the bottom of the classroom, the air below becomes warm and goes up, and the cold air above goes down, and as it heats up again, gas circulation occurs. Therefore, it is better to install it below the top",27,,,,
