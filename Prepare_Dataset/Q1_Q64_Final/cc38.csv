79,79,"This is because the gas in the expanded plastic bottle is put in the refrigerator due to the hot temperature, and the temperature decreases rapidly, causing the gas in the plastic bottle to contract.",79.0,"81,1,1,0, because the temperature of the air in the bottle decreases, the volume of the container decreases"
80,80,"If the temperature is high, the volume of the gas expands, and if the temperature is lowered, the volume of the gas decreases, so if you put the plastic bottle outside in the refrigerator, the volume of the gas decreases, so the bottle is crushed.",80.0,"82,1,0, because the air in the bottle cools down, the volume of the container decreases"
81,81,"The reason why the plastic bottle outside is crushed when put in the refrigerator in summer is that the temperature of the air in the refrigerator is lower, which is larger than the density of the air inside the plastic bottle, so the pressure is higher.",81.0,"83,1,0, cooling of the air in the bottle, reducing the volume inside the container"
82,82,"Gas in a plastic bottle has a volume suitable for a certain temperature, and when placed in a refrigerator, the temperature of the gas decreases and the volume of the gas decreases and is crushed.",82.0,"84,1,0, as the air in the bottle cools, the volume inside the container decreases rapidly"
83,83,"The temperature of the plastic bottle decreases, reducing the volume of the gas in the bottle",83.0,"85, 1, 1, 0, the temperature of the air in the bottle decreases, because the volume inside the container decreases rapidly"

86,86,"If a sealed plastic container is left at a high temperature, gas particles inside the plastic container receive heat energy, which activates molecular movement. Accordingly, the number of air particles hitting the inner wall of the plastic cylinder increases. On the other hand, gas particles in the refrigerator are deprived of heat energy from the surroundings due to low ambient temperature, and molecular motion is also slowed, reducing the number of gas particles hitting objects. When a heated plastic container is placed inside the refrigerator, the pressure inside the container is relative to the refrigerator (outside)",86.0,"88,1,1,0, because the temperature of the air in the bottle decreases, the volume decreases and the size of the plastic bottle decreases89,1,0,1 Because the temperature of the air in the bottle decreases, the size of the plastic bottle decreases"
87,87,"In summer, atoms inside plastic move actively because of the high temperature. At this time, if you put the plastic bottle in the refrigerator, the temperature suddenly decreases, so the atoms inside the plastic suddenly slow down. Therefore, if you put plastic bottles outside in the refrigerator in the summer, they will be crushed.",87.0,"90,1,0, because the temperature of the air in the bottle decreases, the size of the plastic bottle decreases"
88,88,"According to the gas abnormality equation, the temperature is proportional to the pressure when the volume is constant, so the plastic bottle in the refrigerator is crushed because the temperature decreases, the internal pressure decreases, and the internal pressure is relatively lower than the external pressure.",88.0,"91,1,0, because the temperature of the air in the bottle decreases, the bottle is crushed as the volume inside the container decreases"
89,89,"The higher the temperature, the more active the motion of the gas becomes. That is, when the temperature of the gas in the enclosed space is changed, the degree of motion is changed, and thus the volume is also changes. The plastic bottle outside heats up, increasing the volume of gas in the plastic bottle. Putting the bottle in a cold refrigerator reduces temperature, reducing gas motion, and reducing volume. Therefore, the bottle is crushed.",89.0,"92,1,0,0 because the temperature of the air in the bottle drops"
90,90,"This is because the gas in the plastic bottle, which has increased in volume because it is warm, entered the refrigerator filled with cold air, and the air in the plastic bottle contracted, reducing the volume.",90.0,"93,1,1,0, because the air in the bottle gets cold"
91,91,Because of the temperature difference,91.0,"94,1,0, the temperature gets lower"
92,92,"Gas increases in volume when the temperature increases, and decreases in volume when the temperature decreases. If you put a plastic bottle in the refrigerator where the temperature is high, the temperature decreases, reducing the volume of the gas in the plastic bottle, which causes the plastic bottle to be crushed.",92.0,"95,1,1,0 because the temperature gets lower"
93,93,"The air in the plastic bottle is heated, so the mass, or density, of air per same volume decreases. In this state, when the lid is closed and put into the refrigerator, the low-density air inside is cooled and the volume is reduced, so it is crushed.",93.0,"96,1,0,1, temperature drop,"
94,94,"The volume of the gas is related to the temperature, and the air in the plastic bottle has a high temperature, which increases the volume of the gas. However, because the temperature of the refrigerator is lower than outside, the volume of the gas decreases and becomes crushed.",94.0,"97,1,1,1, the temperature goes down"
95,95,"In summer, if a plastic bottle that is heated outside and the internal pressure increases suddenly enters the refrigerator and the temperature decreases, the internal pressure decreases and the plastic bottle decreases.",95.0,"Because 98,1,1,1, the temperature goes down"
96,96,"In summer, the temperature is high and the air in the plastic bottle is active, so there are many collisions with the plastic bottle, but when placed in the refrigerator, the temperature decreases, and the air in the plastic bottle slows down, causing the plastic bottle to crush.",96.0,"99,1,1,0, because the temperature gets lower,"
97,97,"When plastic bottles are placed outside in summer, the air inside becomes active and the air pressure is lowered. As the temperature increases, the molecular motion of air increases, so the volume increases, and as the volume increases with air of the same mass, the internal air pressure increases. But when you put it in the refrigerator, the temperature drops rapidly. When the temperature decreases, the molecular motion slows down, so the volume decreases and the internal pressure decreases because of the same mass of air, so the external pressure is relatively high and the force to press the plastic bottle becomes strong and crushed.",97.0,"Because 100,1,0,0, the temperature goes down"
98,98,"The air in the plastic bottle decreases in molecular motion and volume as the temperature decreases. As the air volume of the plastic bottle decreases and the air pressure decreases, the air pressure of the outside air increases relatively, and the volume of the bottle decreases in order to make the air pressure equal.When you put a plastic bottle outside in the summer, the air inside becomes hot due to heat energy. The volume of air increases as the temperature increases, which also occurs in plastic bottles placed outside. It exists in a state in which the volume is relatively large and the pressure inside the bottle is increased. If you put a plastic bottle in this state in a refrigerator with a low temperature, the temperature of the air whose temperature has risen decreases, and the volume of the air whose temperature has decreased also decreases. The reduced volume of air causes a decrease in the pressure of pushing the PET bottle, which causes the external pressure to be relatively strong and causes the PET bottle to be crushed.",98.0,"101,1,0, because the temperature of the refrigerator is low"
99,99,"Gas tends to expand as the temperature increases, and contracts as the temperature decreases. Comparing the temperature of room temperature in summer with the temperature inside the refrigerator, the temperature of room temperature in summer is relatively higher. So, when the gas in the bottle, which was placed at room temperature, enters the refrigerator, it means that it moves from a high temperature to a low temperature. Therefore, the gas in the bottle will shrink and the bottle will be crushed because it means that the temperature will move to a place where it is low.",99.0,"102,1,0, because the temperature of the refrigerator is low"
